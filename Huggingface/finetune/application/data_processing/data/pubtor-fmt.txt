11102979|t|Genetic testing for hereditary hearing loss: connexin 26 (GJB2) allele variants and two novel deafness-causing mutations (R32C and 645-648delTAGA).
11102979|a|Mutations in GJB2 are the most common cause of hereditary congenital hearing loss in many countries and are found in about half of persons with severe-to-profound congenital autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL). We report the results of GJB2 mutation screening in 209 consecutive persons with congenital deafness of indeterminate etiology using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assay, single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis, and direct sequencing. GJB2 allele variants were detected in 74 of 209 deaf individuals (35%). Over one-fourth of screened individuals were either homozygous (n=31) or heterozygous (n=24) for the 35delG mutation. Of those with the 35delG mutation, 51 (92.7%) were diagnosed with GJB2-related deafness. Nineteen persons were identified with other GJB2 allele variants - two novel deafness-causing mutations (R32C, 645-648delTAGA), one mutation of unknown significance (E47K), and one benign polymorphism (I128I). While these data enable health care professionals to provide parents and patients with improved genetic counseling data, difficulty still exists is determining whether some missense mutations compromise auditory function and are deafness-causing.

29065368|t|BBOX1 is down-regulated in maternal immune-activated mice and implicated in genetic susceptibility to human schizophrenia.
29065368|a|Prenatal exposure to infectious or inflammatory insults can increase the risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, autism, and schizophrenia in later life. Gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase (BBOX 1) is an enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of l-carnitine, a key molecule in fatty acid metabolism. This cytosolic dimeric protein belongs to the dioxygenase family. In this study, we investigated whether BBOX 1 expression was related to psychiatric disorder in an animal model. We also conducted a case-control study using 284 schizophrenia patients and 409 controls with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5'-near region of BBOX 1. BBOX 1 expression was increased in the medial frontal cortex of a mouse model of schizophrenia induced by maternal immune activation. Furthermore, the genotype and allele frequencies of two SNPs (rs7939644 and rs10767592) were significantly associated with schizophrenia susceptibility. Our results suggest that BBOX 1 might be associated with maternal immune activation and schizophrenia susceptibility. Therefore, it might be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

21926974|t|Genome-wide association study identifies five new schizophrenia loci.
21926974|a|We examined the role of common genetic variation in schizophrenia in a genome-wide association study of substantial size: a stage 1 discovery sample of 21,856 individuals of European ancestry and a stage 2 replication sample of 29,839 independent subjects. The combined stage 1 and 2 analysis yielded genome-wide significant associations with schizophrenia for seven loci, five of which are new (1p21.3, 2q32.3, 8p23.2, 8q21.3 and 10q24.32-q24.33) and two of which have been previously implicated (6p21.32-p22.1 and 18q21.2). The strongest new finding (P = 1.6 × 10(-11)) was with rs1625579 within an intron of a putative primary transcript for MIR137 (microRNA 137), a known regulator of neuronal development. Four other schizophrenia loci achieving genome-wide significance contain predicted targets of MIR137, suggesting MIR137-mediated dysregulation as a previously unknown etiologic mechanism in schizophrenia. In a joint analysis with a bipolar disorder sample (16,374 affected individuals and 14,044 controls), three loci reached genome-wide significance: CACNA1C (rs4765905, P = 7.0 × 10(-9)), ANK3 (rs10994359, P = 2.5 × 10(-8)) and the ITIH3-ITIH4 region (rs2239547, P = 7.8 × 10(-9)).

12554680|t|Defective endocytic trafficking of NPC1 and NPC2 underlying infantile Niemann-Pick type C disease.
12554680|a|Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a fatal recessively inherited lysosomal cholesterol-sphingolipidosis. Mutations in the NPC1 gene cause approximately 95% of the cases, the rest being caused by NPC2 mutations. Here the molecular basis of a severe infantile form of the disease was dissected. The level of NPC1 protein in the patient fibroblasts was similar to that in control cells. However, the protein was partially mislocalized from late endocytic organelles diffusely to the cell periphery. In contrast, NPC2 was upregulated and accumulated in cholesterol storing late endocytic organelles. Two point mutations and a four-nucleotide deletion were identified in the NPC1 gene, leading to the amino acid substitutions C113R, P237S and deletion of 37 C-terminal amino acids (delC). Overexpression of individual NPC1 mutations revealed that delC produced an unstable protein, wild-type and NPC1-P237S colocalized with Rab7-positive late endosomes whereas NPC1-C113R localized to the ER, Rab7-negative endosomes and the cell surface. Expression of wild-type or NPC1-P237S cleared the lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in NPC1-deficient cells whereas C113R or delC did not. In the Finnish and Swedish population samples, alleles carrying C113R or delC were not identified, whereas approximately 5% of the alleles carried P237S. Our studies identify P237S as a prevalent NPC1 polymorphism and delC and C113R as deleterious NPC1 mutations. Moreover, they show that delC leads to rapid degradation of NPC1 and C113R to endocytic missorting of the protein. These changes are accompanied by lysosomal accumulation of NPC2, suggesting that NPC1 governs the endocytic transport of NPC2.

31562340|t|Characterizing rare and low-frequency height-associated variants in the Japanese population.
31562340|a|Human height is a representative phenotype to elucidate genetic architecture. However, the majority of large studies have been performed in European population. To investigate the rare and low-frequency variants associated with height, we construct a reference panel (N = 3,541) for genotype imputation by integrating the whole-genome sequence data from 1,037 Japanese with that of the 1000 Genomes Project, and perform a genome-wide association study in 191,787 Japanese. We report 573 height-associated variants, including 22 rare and 42 low-frequency variants. These 64 variants explain 1.7% of the phenotypic variance. Furthermore, a gene-based analysis identifies two genes with multiple height-increasing rare and low-frequency nonsynonymous variants (SLC27A3 and CYP26B1; P

17804836|t|TRAF1-C5 as a risk locus for rheumatoid arthritis--a genomewide study.
17804836|a|Rheumatoid arthritis has a complex mode of inheritance. Although HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22 are well-established susceptibility loci, other genes that confer a modest level of risk have been identified recently. We carried out a genomewide association analysis to identify additional genetic loci associated with an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis.We genotyped 317,503 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a combined case-control study of 1522 case subjects with rheumatoid arthritis and 1850 matched control subjects. The patients were seropositive for autoantibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP). We obtained samples from two data sets, the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) and the Swedish Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (EIRA). Results from NARAC and EIRA for 297,086 SNPs that passed quality-control filters were combined with the use of Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel stratified analysis. SNPs showing a significant association with disease (P<1x10(-8)) were genotyped in an independent set of case subjects with anti-CCP-positive rheumatoid arthritis (485 from NARAC and 512 from EIRA) and in control subjects (1282 from NARAC and 495 from EIRA).We observed associations between disease and variants in the major-histocompatibility-complex locus, in PTPN22, and in a SNP (rs3761847) on chromosome 9 for all samples tested, the latter with an odds ratio of 1.32 (95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.42; P=4x10(-14)). The SNP is in linkage disequilibrium with two genes relevant to chronic inflammation: TRAF1 (encoding tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1) and C5 (encoding complement component 5).A common genetic variant at the TRAF1-C5 locus on chromosome 9 is associated with an increased risk of anti-CCP-positive rheumatoid arthritis.

15870828|t|Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer: pitfalls in deletion screening in MSH2 and MLH1 genes.
15870828|a|Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair in consequence of germline mutations mainly in the genes MSH2 and MLH1. Around 10% of patients suspected of HNPCC are identified with large genomic deletions that cannot be detected by conventional methods of mutation screening. The recently developed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) proved to be an easy to perform method for deletion detection and is reliable when more than one exon is deleted. We show that, in some cases, apparent deletions of single exons may actually result from single base substitutions or small insertions/deletions in the hybridisation sequence of MLPA probes. We conclude that single exon deletions, detected by MLPA or multiplex PCR, should be validated with additional methods.

27182965|t|Detection and interpretation of shared genetic influences on 42 human traits.
27182965|a|We performed a scan for genetic variants associated with multiple phenotypes by comparing large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 42 traits or diseases. We identified 341 loci (at a false discovery rate of 10%) associated with multiple traits. Several loci are associated with multiple phenotypes; for example, a nonsynonymous variant in the zinc transporter SLC39A8 influences seven of the traits, including risk of schizophrenia (rs13107325: log-transformed odds ratio (log OR) = 0.15, P = 2 × 10(-12)) and Parkinson disease (log OR = -0.15, P = 1.6 × 10(-7)), among others. Second, we used these loci to identify traits that have multiple genetic causes in common. For example, variants associated with increased risk of schizophrenia also tended to be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, we developed a method to identify pairs of traits that show evidence of a causal relationship. For example, we show evidence that increased body mass index causally increases triglyceride levels.

21743469|t|Interaction between ERAP1 and HLA-B27 in ankylosing spondylitis implicates peptide handling in the mechanism for HLA-B27 in disease susceptibility.
21743469|a|Ankylosing spondylitis is a common form of inflammatory arthritis predominantly affecting the spine and pelvis that occurs in approximately 5 out of 1,000 adults of European descent. Here we report the identification of three variants in the RUNX3, LTBR-TNFRSF1A and IL12B regions convincingly associated with ankylosing spondylitis (P < 5 × 10(-8) in the combined discovery and replication datasets) and a further four loci at PTGER4, TBKBP1, ANTXR2 and CARD9 that show strong association across all our datasets (P < 5 × 10(-6) overall, with support in each of the three datasets studied). We also show that polymorphisms of ERAP1, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase involved in peptide trimming before HLA class I presentation, only affect ankylosing spondylitis risk in HLA-B27-positive individuals. These findings provide strong evidence that HLA-B27 operates in ankylosing spondylitis through a mechanism involving aberrant processing of antigenic peptides.

23281178|t|A genome-wide assessment of variability in human serum metabolism.
23281178|a|The study of the genetic regulation of metabolism in human serum samples can contribute to a better understanding of the intermediate biological steps that lead from polymorphism to disease. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to discover metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) utilizing samples from a study of prostate cancer in Swedish men, consisting of 402 individuals (214 cases and 188 controls) in a discovery set and 489 case-only samples in a replication set. A global nontargeted metabolite profiling approach was utilized resulting in the detection of 6,138 molecular features followed by targeted identification of associated metabolites. Seven replicating loci were identified (PYROXD2, FADS1, PON1, CYP4F2, UGT1A8, ACADL, and LIPC) with associated sequence variants contributing significantly to trait variance for one or more metabolites (P = 10(-13) -10(-91)). Regional mQTL enrichment analyses implicated two loci that included FADS1 and a novel locus near PDGFC. Biological pathway analysis implicated ACADM, ACADS, ACAD8, ACAD10, ACAD11, and ACOXL, reflecting significant enrichment of genes with acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. mQTL SNPs and mQTL-harboring genes were over-represented across GWASs conducted to date, suggesting that these data may have utility in tracing the molecular basis of some complex disease associations.

17914575|t|Loss of TP53-DNA interaction induced by p.C135R in lung cancer.
17914575|a|The p53 tumor suppressor gene (TP53; OMIM: 191170) plays an important role in tumorigenesis in lung epithelial cells. TP53 encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that regulates transcription of several genes in response to DNA damage promoting cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis. A mutation does not necessarily alter the protein function and since not all altered tumor protein p53 (TP53) conformations lead to the same biological properties, we studied Cys135Arg TP53 gene mutation in squamous cell type of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing. Cys135Arg TP53 mutation, rare in databases (11/23544 in R11, IARC TP53 database), was detected. We chose p.C135R in order to examine DNA-TP53 interaction. A comparison with the wild-type after 1 nano-second molecular dynamic simulation analysis revealed a significant structural change (over 4A displacement) in the contact loop Lys-Ser-Val which lies upstream and next to the mutated site in the TP53, that sterically prevents its DNA-binding activity. Additionally, the mutation produced a change in the electrostatic potential surface of the protein in the same loop where the structural modification took place. To demonstrate the degree of loss of function, functional assays in yeast and bacteria with oligonucleotides for competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were done proving that this mutation decreases TP53 ability to bind DNA of the TP53 response element from the human p21 gene. These results demonstrate that the amino acid change C135R in the human TP53 generates the loss of TP53 DNA-binding activity directly affecting its role as a transcription factor and suggests that this observation can explain part of the phenotype described in patients affected by this type of tumor.

22092154|t|Acute encephalopathy in children with Dravet syndrome.
22092154|a|The occurrence of acute encephalopathy in children with Dravet syndrome has been reported sporadically. This study clarified the features of acute encephalopathy in children with Dravet syndrome.Through the mailing list of the Annual Zao Conference on Pediatric Neurology, we collected 15 patients with clinically diagnosed Dravet syndrome, who had acute encephalopathy, defined as a condition with decreased consciousness with or without other neurologic symptoms, such as seizures, lasting for >24 h in association with infectious symptoms.There were seven boys and eight girls. A mutation of the SCN1A gene was present in nine (truncation in six and missense in three). The frequency of seizures during the 3 months before the onset of acute encephalopathy was monthly in seven children and none in three. The median age at the onset of acute encephalopathy was 44 months (range 8-184 months). All children had status epilepticus followed by coma as the initial manifestation. Two different distributions of brain lesions were observed on diffusion-weighted images during the acute phase: cerebral cortex-dominant lesions with or without deep gray matter involvement and subcortical-dominant lesions. Four children died; nine survived with severe sequelae, and two had moderate sequelae.We must be aware that acute encephalopathy is an important complication in children with Dravet syndrome, and associated with fulminant clinical manifestations and a poor outcome.

26318430|t|Association of cancer stem cell markers genetic variants with gallbladder cancer susceptibility, prognosis, and survival.
26318430|a|Genes important to stem cell progression have been involved in the genetics and clinical outcome of cancers. We investigated germ line variants in cancer stem cell (CSC) genes to predict susceptibility and efficacy of chemoradiotherapy treatment in gallbladder cancer (GBC) patients. In this study, we assessed the effect of SNPs in CSC genes (surface markers CD44, ALCAM, EpCAM, CD133) and (molecular markers NANOG, SOX-2, LIN-28A, ALDH1A1, OCT-4) with GBC susceptibility and prognosis. Total 610 GBC patients and 250 controls were genotyped by using PCR-RFLP, ARMS-PCR, and TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Chemotoxicity graded 2-4 in 200 patients and tumor response was recorded in 140 patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Differences in genotype and haplotype frequency distributions were calculated by binary logistic regression. Gene-gene interaction model was analyzed by generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR). Overall survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival curve and multivariate Cox-proportional methods. ALCAM Ars1157Crs10511244 (P = 0.0035) haplotype was significantly associated with GBC susceptibility. In GMDR analysis, ALCAM rs1157G>A, EpCAM rs1126497T>C emerged as best significant interaction model with GBC susceptibility and ALDH1A1 rs13959T>G with increased risk of grade 3-4 hematological toxicity. SOX-2 rs11915160A>C, OCT-4 rs3130932T>G, and NANOG rs11055786T>C were found best gene-gene interaction model for predicting response to NACT. In both Cox-proportional and recursive partitioning ALCAM rs1157GA+AA genotype showed higher mortality and hazard ratio. ALCAM gene polymorphisms associated with GBC susceptibility and survival while OCT-4, SOX-2, and NANOG variants showed an interactive role with treatment response. 

22113474|t|Genetic variants in interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) are associated with atopic dermatitis and eczema herpeticum.
22113474|a|Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) is a member of a family of transcriptional factors involved in the modulation of IFN-induced immune responses to viral infection. To test whether genetic variants in IRF2 predict risk of atopic dermatitis (AD) and ADEH (atopic dermatitis complicated by eczema herpeticum), we genotyped 78 IRF2 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in both European-American (n = 435) and African-American (n = 339) populations. Significant associations were observed between AD and two SNPs (rs793814, P = 0.007, odds ratio (OR) = 0.52; rs3756094, P = 0.037, OR = 0.66) among European Americans and one SNP (rs3775572, P = 0.016, OR = 0.46) among African Americans. Significant associations were also observed between ADEH and five SNPs (P = 0.049-0.022) among European Americans. The association with ADEH was further strengthened by haplotype analyses, wherein a five-SNP (CAGGA) haplotype showed the strongest association with ADEH (P = 0.0008). Eight IRF2 SNPs were significantly associated with IFN-γ production after herpes simplex virus (HSV) stimulation (P = 0.048-0.0008), including an AD-associated SNP (rs13139310, P = 0.008). Our findings suggest that distinct markers in IRF2 may be associated with AD and ADEH, which may depend upon ethnic ancestry, and genetic variants in IRF2 may contribute to an abnormal immune response to HSV.

23226241|t|Association between the melatonin receptor 1B gene polymorphism on the risk of type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose regulation: a meta-analysis.
23226241|a|Melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) belongs to the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor superfamily involved in insulin secretion, which has attracted considerable attention as a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes (T2D) since it was first identified as a loci associated with fasting plasma glucose level through genome wide association approach. The relationship between MTNR1B and T2D has been reported in various ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to consolidate and summarize published data on the potential of MTNR1B polymorphisms in T2D risk prediction.PubMed, EMBASE, ISI web of science and the CNKI databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. Heterogeneity and publication bias were also tested.A total of 23 studies involving 172,963 subjects for two common polymorphisms (rs10830963, rs1387153) on MTNR1B were included. An overall random effects per-allele OR of 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02-1.08; P<10(-4)) and 1.04 (95% CI: 0.98-1.10; P = 0.20) were found for the two variants respectively. Similar results were also observed using dominant or recessive genetic model. There was strong evidence of heterogeneity, which largely disappeared after stratification by ethnicity. Significant results were found in Caucasians when stratified by ethnicity; while no significant associations were observed in East Asians and South Asians. Besides, we found that the rs10830963 polymorphism is a risk factor associated with increased impaired glucose regulation susceptibility.This meta-analysis demonstrated that the rs10830963 polymorphism is a risk factor for developing impaired glucose regulation and T2D.

23263486|t|Genome-wide association analyses identify 18 new loci associated with serum urate concentrations.
23263486|a|Elevated serum urate concentrations can cause gout, a prevalent and painful inflammatory arthritis. By combining data from >140,000 individuals of European ancestry within the Global Urate Genetics Consortium (GUGC), we identified and replicated 28 genome-wide significant loci in association with serum urate concentrations (18 new regions in or near TRIM46, INHBB, SFMBT1, TMEM171, VEGFA, BAZ1B, PRKAG2, STC1, HNF4G, A1CF, ATXN2, UBE2Q2, IGF1R, NFAT5, MAF, HLF, ACVR1B-ACVRL1 and B3GNT4). Associations for many of the loci were of similar magnitude in individuals of non-European ancestry. We further characterized these loci for associations with gout, transcript expression and the fractional excretion of urate. Network analyses implicate the inhibins-activins signaling pathways and glucose metabolism in systemic urate control. New candidate genes for serum urate concentration highlight the importance of metabolic control of urate production and excretion, which may have implications for the treatment and prevention of gout.

18511570|t|Molecular basis of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome: an update from the French LFS families.
18511570|a|We have performed an extensive analysis of TP53 in 474 French families suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), including 232 families fulfilling the Chompret criteria. We identified a germline alteration of TP53 in 82 families (17%), in 67/232 of the families fulfilling the Chompret criteria (29%) and in 15/242 which did not fulfil these criteria (6%). Most of the alterations corresponded to missense mutations (67%), and we identified in four families genomic deletions removing the entire TP53 locus, the promoter and the non-coding exon 1, or exons 2-10. These results represent a definitive argument demonstrating that LFS results from TP53 haplodeficiency. The mean ages of tumour onset were significantly different between patients harbouring TP53 missense mutations and other types of alterations, missense mutations being associated with a 9 year earlier tumour onset. These results confirm that missense mutations not only inactivate p53 but also have an additional oncogenic effect. Germline alterations of TP53 that lead exclusively to loss of function are therefore associated with a later age of tumour onset and the presence of such mutations should be considered in atypical LFS families with tumours diagnosed after 40 years.

25729630|t|Unraveling the genetics of Joubert and Meckel-Gruber syndromes.
25729630|a|Joubert (JBTS) and Meckel-Gruber (MKS) syndromes are recessive neurodevelopmental conditions caused by mutations in proteins that are structural or functional components of the primary cilium. In this review we provide an overview of their clinical diagnosis, management and molecular genetics. Both have variable phenotypes, extreme genetic heterogeneity, and display allelism both with each other and other ciliopathies. Recent advances in genetic technology have significantly improved diagnosis and clinical management of ciliopathy patients, with the delineation of some general genotype-phenotype correlations. We highlight those that are most relevant for clinical practice, including the correlation between 

10408782|t|Molecular characterization of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in Chile. Mutations in brief no. 243. Online.
10408782|a|Both the haplotype distribution and the mutational spectrum of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene has been defined for the Chilean phenylketonuria (PKU) population. Mutation analysis was performed using a combined approach of screening for common European and Oriental mutations and application of the DGGE scanning method in the remaining uncharacterized alleles. A total of 16 different mutations have been identified, including two novel ones, Q232X and IVS11nt5. The most frequent mutations were IVS10nt-11 and V388M present both in the 13% of the mutant chromosomes. The rest of the mutations are rare. The haplotype association including VNTR and STR alleles, was examined to investigated the origin and distribution of PAH alleles in Chile. Our results are consistent with Southern Europeans as the major source of PAH mutations in Latin America. However, we have also detected mutations from East and Central Europe, such IVS12nt1, R408W and R252W. It is clear that the PKU mutation present in each Latin American country varies with the demographic profile and specific mutation scanning is necessary in each population both for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. The correlation between the genotypes and the phenotypes is consistent with the emerging pattern of mutation severity deduced from previous studies in related populations.

18931482|t|Mismatch repair gene mutations in Chinese HNPCC patients.
18931482|a|To explore the characteristics of DNA mismatch repair gene mutations in Chinese patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch syndrome, the MLH1 and MSH2 genes from probands of 76 HNPCC families were sequenced. By doing so, two frame-shift mutations, three splice-site mutations and fourteen missense mutations (thirteen missense mutations and one nonsense mutation) were identified in the MLH1 gene. In addition, one splice-site mutation and six missense mutations were detected in the MSH2 gene. None of these mutations were detected in 100 matched healthy controls. The remaining mutation-negative cases were subjected to large fragment deletion analysis using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). By doing so, five large fragment deletions were detected in the MSH2 gene. No large fragment deletions were detected in the MLH1 gene. We conclude that the MLH1 and MSH2 genes in Chinese HNPCC families exhibit broad mutation spectra.

23923981|t|ATP6V1B1 mutations in distal renal tubular acidosis and sensorineural hearing loss: clinical and genetic spectrum of five families.
23923981|a|Distal renal tubular acidosis (DRTA) is characterized by tubular defects in urinary acidification and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. Mutations in ATP6V1B1 cause DRTA associated with sensorineural hearing loss. The objective of this multicenter study is to screen DRTA patients with sensorineural hearing loss for ATP6V1B1 gene mutations and present genotype/phenotype correlation. Clinical data in five unrelated consanguineous families with DRTA and hearing loss were obtained in Turkey. For mutation screening, all coding exons of ATP6V1B1 were PCR-amplified and sequenced from genomic DNA. In our cohort of five families, there were four different homozygous ATP6V1B1 mutations in affected individuals: c.91C>T (p.R31X), c.232G>A (p.G78R), c.497delC (p.T166RfsX9) and c.1155dupC (p.I386HfsX56). Our study shows that rare and family-specific variants in ATP6V1B1 are responsible for DRTA and sensorineural hearing loss syndrome in Turkey. While firm genotype-phenotype correlations are not available, detailed clinical and molecular analyses provide data to be used in genetic counseling.

17293347|t|Regulated binding of adenomatous polyposis coli protein to actin.
17293347|a|Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein is a large tumor suppressor that is truncated in most colorectal cancers. The carboxyl-terminal third of APC protein mediates direct interactions with microtubules and the microtubule plus-end tracking protein EB1. In addition, APC has been localized to actin-rich regions of cells, but the mechanism and functional significance of this localization have remained unclear. Here we show that purified carboxyl-terminal basic domain of human APC protein (APC-basic) bound directly to and bundled actin filaments and associated with actin stress fibers in microinjected cells. Actin filaments and microtubules competed for binding to APC-basic, but APC-basic also could cross-link actin filaments and microtubules at specific concentrations, suggesting a possible role in cytoskeletal cross-talk. APC interactions with actin in vitro were inhibited by its ligand EB1, and co-microinjection of EB1 prevented APC association with stress fibers. Point mutations in EB1 that disrupted APC binding relieved the inhibition in vitro and restored APC localization to stress fibers in vivo, demonstrating that EB1-APC regulation is direct. Because tumor formation and metastasis involve coordinated changes in the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, this novel function for APC and its regulation by EB1 may have direct implications for understanding the molecular basis of tumor suppression.

23170061|t|Clinical characterization and mitochondrial DNA sequence variations in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.
23170061|a|Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a maternally inherited disorder, results from point mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). MtDNA is highly polymorphic in nature with very high mutation rate, 10-17 fold higher as compared to nuclear genome. Identification of new mtDNA sequence variations is necessary to establish a clean link with human disease. Thus this study was aimed to assess or evaluate LHON patients for novel mtDNA sequence variations.Twenty LHON patients were selected from the neuro-ophthalmology clinic of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. DNA was isolated from whole blood samples. The entire coding region of the mitochondrial genome was amplified by PCR in 20 patients and 20 controls. For structural analysis (molecular modeling and simulation) the MODELER 9.2 program in Discovery Studio (DS 2.0) was used.MtDNA sequencing revealed a total of 47 nucleotide variations in the 20 LHON patients and 29 variations in 20 controls. Of 47 changes in patients 21.2% (10/47) were nonsynonymous and the remaining 78.72% (37/47) were synonymous. Five nonsynonymous changes, including primary LHON mutations (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 [ND1]:p.A52T, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 [ND6]:p.M64V, adenosine triphosphate [ATP] synthase subunit a (F-ATPase protein 6) [ATPase6]:p.M181T, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 [ND4]:p.R340H, and cytochrome B [CYB]:p.F181L), were found to be pathogenic. A greater number of changes were present in complex I (53.19%; 25/47), followed by complex III (19.14%; 9/47), then complex IV (19.14%; 9/47), then complex V (8.5%; 4/47). Nonsynonymous variations may impair respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathways, which results in low ATP production and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Oxidative stress is the underlying etiology in various diseases and also plays a crucial role in LHON.This study describes the role of mtDNA sequence variations in LHON patients. Primary LHON mutations of mtDNA are main variants leading to LHON, but mutations in other mitochondrial genes may also play an important role in pathogenesis of LHON as indicated in the present study. Certain alleles in certain haplogroups have protective or deleterious roles and hence there is a need to analyze a large number of cases for correlating phenotype and disease severity with mutation and mtDNA haplogroups.

27113481|t|Expressional profiling of prostate cancer risk SNPs at 11q13.5 identifies DGAT2 as a new target gene.
27113481|a|A total of nine non-coding variants on 11q13.5 predispose men to prostate cancer (PrCa). rs200331695 within the EMSY intron is associated with aggressive PrCa and two high linkage disequilibrium (LD) groups of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the intergenic region are associated with PrCa death. Here, the cis-effect of the SNPs on gene expression using expression quantitative trait loci analysis was investigated. The regulatory potential was screened in prostate tumors (n = 41) and in whole blood (n = 99). The results were validated in a second tumor set (n = 41), in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) (n = 38), and using the GTEx Portal. The effects of haplotypes were analyzed in the whole blood. The high LD SNPs (rs143975731, rs12277366, rs2155225, and rs2155222) were associated with DGAT2 expression in both tumors sets (screening P = 0.035-0.043; validation P = 0.005-0.018). The PrCa death-associated alleles decreased the expression by two-fold. rs200331695 decreased DGAT2 expression in LCLs (P = 0.006). The findings of SNPs regulating CAPN5 (P = 0.026-0.046) and AP001189.4 (P = 0.03-0.039) in the whole blood were not observed in LCLs, but the association with AP001189.4 expression was validated via the GTEx Portal (P = 8.7 × 10(-5) to 4.3 × 10(-4) ), which suggests that the high LD intergenic SNPs exert a tissue-dependent effect on the expression of two genes. No haplotypes including the risk SNPs at 11q13.5 were associated with gene expression and PrCa. The findings indicate the functionality of the PrCa death-predisposing SNPs rs143975731, rs12277366, rs2155225, and rs2155222 as DGAT2 regulators in prostate tumors. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

1840561|t|Pro-347-Arg mutation of the rhodopsin gene in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.
1840561|a|It has been shown recently that autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa may be caused by point mutations of the rhodopsin gene in a portion of families. In this communication, a large six-generation family with autosomal dominant RP is described. Molecular analysis by PCR amplification followed by restriction digestion or heteroduplex analysis suggested a point mutation in codon 347, in which two different mutations (Pro-347-Ser and Pro-347-Leu) have already been reported. Direct sequencing of the patients' DNA revealed a previously undescribed CCG----CGG transversion in codon 347 predicting a Pro----Arg substitution. Ophthalmological data of the patients are summarized and compared to those of patients with other mutations in the rhodopsin gene.

21326295|t|Genome-wide analysis identifies a quantitative trait locus in the MHC class II region associated with generalized vitiligo age of onset.
21326295|a|Generalized vitiligo is a common autoimmune disease in which acquired patchy depigmentation of skin, hair, and mucous membranes results from loss of melanocytes from involved areas. Previous genetic analyses have focused on vitiligo susceptibility, and have identified a number of genes involved in disease risk. Age of onset of generalized vitiligo also involves a substantial genetic component, but has not previously been studied systematically. In this study, we report a genome-wide association study of vitiligo age of onset in 1,339 generalized vitiligo patients, with replication in an independent cohort of 677 cases. We identified a quantitative trait locus for vitiligo age of onset in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II region, located near c6orf10-BTNL2 (rs7758128; P=8.14 × 10(-11)), a region that is also associated with generalized vitiligo susceptibility. In contrast, there was no association of vitiligo age of onset with any other MHC or non-MHC loci that are associated with vitiligo susceptibility. These findings highlight the differing roles played by genes involved in vitiligo susceptibility versus vitiligo age of onset, and illustrate that genome-wide analyses can be used to identify genes involved in quantitative aspects of disease natural history, as well as disease susceptibility per se.

17198989|t|A sodium channel pore mutation causing Brugada syndrome.
17198989|a|Brugada and long QT type 3 syndromes are linked to sodium channel mutations and clinically cause arrhythmias that lead to sudden death. We have identified a novel threonine-to-isoleucine missense mutation at position 353 (T353I) adjacent to the pore-lining region of domain I of the cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A) in a family with Brugada syndrome. Both male and female carriers are symptomatic at young ages, have typical Brugada-type electrocardiogram changes, and have relatively normal corrected QT intervals.To characterize the properties of the newly identified cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A) mutation at the cellular level.Using whole-cell voltage clamp, we found that heterologous expression of SCN5A containing the T353I mutation resulted in 74% +/- 6% less peak macroscopic sodium current when compared with wild-type channels. A construct of the T353I mutant channel fused with green fluorescent protein failed to traffic properly to the sarcolemma, with a large proportion of channels sequestered intracellularly. Overnight exposure to 0.1 mM mexiletine, a Na(+) channel blocking agent, increased T353I channel trafficking to the membrane to near normal levels, but the mutant channels showed a significant late current that was 1.6% +/- 0.2% of peak sodium current at 200 ms, a finding seen with long QT mutations.The clinical presentation of patients carrying the T353I mutation is that of Brugada syndrome and could be explained by a cardiac Na(+) channel trafficking defect. However, when the defect was ameliorated, the mutated channels had biophysical properties consistent with long QT syndrome. The lack of phenotypic changes associated with the long QT syndrome could be explained by a T353I-induced trafficking defect reducing the number of mutant channels with persistent currents present at the sarcolemma.

30660753|t|Mutation in Cytochrome B gene causes debility and adverse effects on health of sheep.
30660753|a|Cytochrome B is the mitochondrial protein, which functions as part of the electron transport chain and is the main subunit of transmembrane cytochrome bc1 and b6f complexes affecting energy metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation. The present study was conducted to study the effect of mutation of Cytochrome B gene on the health condition of sheep, which the first report of association of mitochondrial gene with disease traits in livestock species. Non-synonymous substitutions (F33 L and D171N) and Indel mutations were observed for Cytochrome B gene, leading to a truncated protein, where anemia, malfunctioning of most of the vital organs as liver, kidney and mineral status was observed and debility with exercise intolerance and cardiomyopathy in extreme cases were depicted. These findings were confirmed by bioinformatics analysis, haematological and biochemical data analysis, and other phenotypical physiological data pertaining to different vital organs. The molecular mechanism of cytochrome B mutation was that the mutant variant interferes with the site of heme binding (iron containing) domain and calcium binding essential for electron transport chain. Mutation at amino acid site 33 is located within transmembrane helix A, a hydrophobic environment at the Qi site and close to heme binding domain, and mutation effects these domain and diseases occur. Thermodynamic stability was also observed to decrease in mutant variant. Sheep Cytochrome B being genetically more similar to the human, it may be used as a model for studying human diseases related to cytochrome B defects. Future prospect of the study includes the therapeutic application of recombinant protein, gene therapy and marker-assisted selection of disease-resistant livestock.

19941167|t|Heterogeneous prevalence of recurrent BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Spain according to the geographical area: implications for genetic testing.
19941167|a|BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have a high allelic heterogeneity. The knowledge of the most prevalent mutations and their geographical distribution can be useful in designing efficient mutational screening. In the present work we reviewed the frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 recurrent mutations in seven geographic areas of Spain to evaluate the effects of their heterogeneous prevalence in genetic testing. We observed that prevalence of recurrent mutations vary according to the geographical origin of the studied families, and accounted for a variable number of positive families depending on the series. Therefore, more upcoming data of larger Spanish population cohorts collected from different areas in the country will allow to design a wider comprehensive panel of recurrent mutations that may be applicable worldwide to families with Hispanic origin.

21462282|t|Classifying variants of CDKN2A using computational and laboratory studies.
21462282|a|Variants in the CDKN2A tumor suppressor are associated with Familial Melanoma (FM), although for many variants the linkage is weak. The effects of missense variants on protein function and pathogenicity are often unclear. Multiple methods (e.g., laboratory, computational, epidemiological) have been developed to analyze whether a missense variant is pathogenic or not. It is not yet clear how to integrate these data types into a strategy for variant classification. We studied 51 CDKN2A missense variants using a cell cycle arrest assay. There was a continuum of results ranging from full wild-type effect through partial activity to complete loss of arrest. A reproducible decrease of 30% of cell cycle arrest activity correlated with FM association. We analyzed missense CDKN2A germline variants using a Bayesian method to combine multiple data types and derive a probability of pathogenicity. When equal to or more than two data types could be evaluated with this method, 22 of 25 FM-associated variants and 8 of 15 variants of uncertain significance were classified as likely pathogenic with >95% probability. The other 10 variants were classified as uncertain (probability 5-95%). For most variants, there were insufficient data to draw a conclusion. The Bayesian model appears to be a sound method of classifying missense variants in cancer susceptibility genes.

10377081|t|Congenital long-QT syndrome caused by a novel mutation in a conserved acidic domain of the cardiac Na+ channel.
10377081|a|Congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited condition of abnormal cardiac excitability characterized clinically by an increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. One form, LQT3, is caused by mutations in the cardiac voltage-dependent sodium channel gene, SCN5A. Only 5 SCN5A mutations have been associated with LQTS, and more work is needed to improve correlations between SCN5A genotypes and associated clinical syndromes.We researched a 3-generation white family with autosomal dominant LQTS who exhibited a wide clinical spectrum from mild bradycardia to sudden death. Molecular genetic studies revealed a single nucleotide substitution in SCN5A exon 28 that caused the substitution of Glu1784 by Lys (E1784K). The mutation occurs in a highly conserved domain within the C-terminus of the cardiac sodium channel containing multiple, negatively charged amino acids. Two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings of a recombinant E1784K mutant channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes revealed a defect in fast inactivation characterized by a small, persistent current during long membrane depolarizations. Coexpression of the mutant with the human sodium channel beta1-subunit did not affect the persistent current, even though we did observe shifts in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. Neutralizing multiple, negatively charged residues in the same region of the sodium channel C-terminus did not cause a more severe functional defect.We characterized the genetics and molecular pathophysiology of a novel SCN5A sodium channel mutation, E1784K. The functional defect exhibited by the mutant channel causes delayed myocardial repolarization, and our data on the effects of multiple charge neutralizations in this region of the C-terminus suggest that the molecular mechanism of channel dysfunction involves an allosteric rather than a direct effect on channel gating.

24453288|t|A patient with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma harboring concurrent EGFR L858R, EGFR germline T790M, and PIK3CA mutations: the challenge of interpreting results of comprehensive mutational testing in lung cancer.
24453288|a|Mutational testing has moved to the forefront as an integral component in the management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently 3 targeted therapies (erlotinib, afatinib, and crizotinib) are approved by the FDA to treat patients with specific genetic abnormalities in NSCLC. As mutational screening expands to include a greater number of genes, the results will become more difficult to interpret, particularly if mutations are found in multiple genes or genes that are not actionable at the time of testing. This case report summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of a patient with NSCLC that harbored multiple potentially targetable driver mutations. It also discusses the current NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for mutational testing in NSCLC and the inherent difficulties with interpreting mutational results when multiple mutations are found in a single gene or across multiple genes. 

26910043|t|Dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa, p.Gly56Arg Mutation in NR2E3: Phenotype in a Large Cohort of 24 Cases.
26910043|a|This research is the single largest NR2E3 genotype-phenotype correlation study performed to date in autosomal dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa.The aim of this study is to analyse the frequency of the p.Gly56Arg mutation in NR2E3 for the largest cohort of autosomal dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa patients to date and its associated phenotype.A cohort of 201 unrelated Spanish families affected by autosomal dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa. The p.Gly56Arg mutation in the NR2E3 (NM_014249.2) gene was analysed in 201 families. In the 24 cases where the mutation had been detected, a haplotype analysis linked to the p.Gly56Arg families was performed, using four extragenic polymorphic markers D15S967, D15S1050, D15S204 and D15S188. Phenotype study included presence and age of onset of night blindness, visual field loss and cataracts; and an ophthalmoscopic examination after pupillary dilation and electroretinogram for the 24 cases.Seven of the 201 analyzed families were positive for the p.Gly56Arg, leading to a prevalence of 3.5%. Clinical data were available for 24 subjects. Night blindness was the first noticeable symptom (mean 15.9 years). Visual field loss onset was variable (23.3 ± 11.9 years). Loss of visual acuity appeared late in the disease´s evolution. Most of the patients with cataracts (50%) presented it from the third decade of life. Fundus changes showed inter and intrafamiliar variability, but most of the patients showed typical RP changes and it was common to find macular affectation (47.4%). Electroretinogram was impaired from the beginning of the disease. Two families shared a common haplotype. Additionally, all patients shared a 104Kb region between D15S1050 and the NR2E3 gene.This study highlights the importance of p.Gly56Arg in the NR2E3 gene as a common mutation associated with adRP, and provides new clues to its phenotype, which can allow for a better clinical management and genetic counselling of patients and their families.

22286219|t|Genome-wide association study identifies multiple loci influencing human serum metabolite levels.
22286219|a|Nuclear magnetic resonance assays allow for measurement of a wide range of metabolic phenotypes. We report here the results of a GWAS on 8,330 Finnish individuals genotyped and imputed at 7.7 million SNPs for a range of 216 serum metabolic phenotypes assessed by NMR of serum samples. We identified significant associations (P < 2.31 × 10(-10)) at 31 loci, including 11 for which there have not been previous reports of associations to a metabolic trait or disorder. Analyses of Finnish twin pairs suggested that the metabolic measures reported here show higher heritability than comparable conventional metabolic phenotypes. In accordance with our expectations, SNPs at the 31 loci associated with individual metabolites account for a greater proportion of the genetic component of trait variance (up to 40%) than is typically observed for conventional serum metabolic phenotypes. The identification of such associations may provide substantial insight into cardiometabolic disorders.

30019117|t|The coexistence of copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at a locus can result in distorted calculations of the significance in associating SNPs to disease.
30019117|a|With the recent advance in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) have been extensively reported. Accordingly, the issue of incorrect identification of recombination events that can induce the distortion of multi-allelic or hemizygous variants has received more attention. However, the potential distorted calculation bias or significance of a detected association in a GWAS due to the coexistence of CNVs and SNPs in the same genomic region may remain under-recognized. Here we performed the association study within a congenital scoliosis (CS) cohort whose genetic etiology was recently elucidated as a compound inheritance model, including mostly one rare variant deletion CNV null allele and one common variant non-coding hypomorphic haplotype of the TBX6 gene. We demonstrated that the existence of a deletion in TBX6 led to an overestimation of the contribution of the SNPs on the hypomorphic allele. Furthermore, we generalized a model to explain the calculation bias, or distorted significance calculation for an association study, that can be 'induced' by CNVs at a locus. Meanwhile, overlapping between the disease-associated SNPs from published GWAS and common CNVs (overlap 10%) and pathogenic/likely pathogenic CNVs (overlap 99.69%) was significantly higher than the random distribution (p < 1 × 10

23104005|t|A study based on whole-genome sequencing yields a rare variant at 8q24 associated with prostate cancer.
23104005|a|In Western countries, prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer of men and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in men. Several genome-wide association studies have yielded numerous common variants conferring risk of prostate cancer. Here, we analyzed 32.5 million variants discovered by whole-genome sequencing 1,795 Icelanders. We identified a new low-frequency variant at 8q24 associated with prostate cancer in European populations, rs188140481[A] (odds ratio (OR) = 2.90; P(combined) = 6.2 × 10(-34)), with an average risk allele frequency in controls of 0.54%. This variant is only very weakly correlated (r(2) ≤ 0.06) with previously reported risk variants at 8q24, and its association remains significant after adjustment for all known risk-associated variants. Carriers of rs188140481[A] were diagnosed with prostate cancer 1.26 years younger than non-carriers (P = 0.0059). We also report results for a previously described HOXB13 variant (rs138213197[T]), confirming it as a prostate cancer risk variant in populations from across Europe.

8659549|t|Identification and expression of eight novel mutations among non-Jewish patients with Canavan disease.
8659549|a|Canavan disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait that is caused by the deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA). The majority of patients with Canavan disease are from an Ashkenazi Jewish background. Mutations in ASPA that lead to loss of enzymatic activity have been identified, and E285A and Y231X are the two predominant mutations that account for 97% of the mutant chromosomes in Ashkenazi Jewish patients. The current study was aimed at finding the molecular basis of Canavan disease in 25 independent patients of non-Jewish background. Eight novel and three previously characterized mutations accounted for 80% (40/50) of mutant chromosomes. The A305E missense mutation accounted for 48% (24/50) of mutant chromosomes in patients of western European descent, while the two predominant Jewish mutations each accounted for a single mutant chromosome. The eight novel mutations identified included 1- and 4-bp deletions (32 deltaT and 876 deltaAGAA, respectively) and I16T, G27R, D114E, G123E, C152Y, and R168C missense mutations. The homozygous 32 deltaT deletion was identified in the only known patient of African-American origin with Canavan disease. The heterozygosity for 876 deltaAGAA mutation was identified in three independent patients from England. Six single-base changes leading to missense mutations were identified in patients from Turkey (D114E, R168C), The Netherlands (I16T), Germany (G27R), Ireland (C152Y), and Canada (G123E). A PCR-based protocol is described that was used to introduce mutations in wild-type cDNA. In vitro expression of mutant cDNA clones demonstrated that all of these mutations led to a deficiency of ASPA and should therefore result in Canavan disease.

11007980|t|MECP2 mutation in male patients with non-specific X-linked mental retardation.
11007980|a|In contrast to the preponderance of affected males in families with X-linked mental retardation, Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurological disorder occurring almost exclusively in females. The near complete absence of affected males in RTT families has been explained by the lethal effect of an X-linked gene mutation in hemizygous affected males. We report here on a novel mutation (A140V) in the MECP2 gene detected in one female with mild mental retardation. In a family study, the A140V mutation was found to segregate in the affected daughter and in four adult sons with severe mental retardation. These results indicate that MECP2 mutations are not necessarily lethal in males and that they can be causative of non-specific X-linked mental retardation.

20937265|t|Association of polymorphisms in the genes of the urokinase plasminogen activation system with susceptibility to and severity of non-small cell lung cancer.
20937265|a|Urokinase plasminogen activating (uPA) system is implicated in neoplastic progression. High tissue levels of uPA system components correlate with a poor prognosis in lung cancer. The present study examined the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of uPA and the corresponding receptor, uPAR, for exploring their roles in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The allele frequencies and genotype distributions of uPA rs4065 C/T and uPAR rs344781 (-516 T/C) among 375 NSCLC cases and 380 healthy controls were examined using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Putative association between the above SNPs and clinicopathological characteristics of NSCLC were also analyzed.The genotype frequencies of the variant homozygotes of uPA and uPAR were significantly different between NSCLC and control subjects. Significant association was also observed between the examined genotypes and disease stage of NSCLC. Logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals with uPA rs4065 TT genotype have higher odds ratios (ORs) for lung cancer. Whereas, subjects with uPAR-344781 CC genotype have lower ORs for lung cancer. The patients carrying a homozygous TT genotype at uPA rs4065, or at least a T allele at uPAR-344781 (-516), had a tendency to develop advanced disease.Our results revealed that genetic polymorphisms of the uPA rs4065 C/T and uPAR rs344781 (-516 T/C) were associated with the susceptibility and severity of NSCLC.

16621918|t|Central core disease is due to RYR1 mutations in more than 90% of patients.
16621918|a|Ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) gene mutations are associated with central core disease (CCD), multiminicore disease (MmD) and malignant hyperthermia (MH), and have been reported to be responsible for 47-67% of patients with CCD and rare cases with MmD. However, to date, the true frequency and distribution of the mutations along the RYR1 gene have not been determined yet, since mutation screening has been limited to three 'hot spots', with particular attention to the C-terminal region. In this study, 27 unrelated Japanese CCD patients were included. Clinical histories and muscle biopsies were carefully reviewed. We sequenced all the 106 exons encoding RYR1 with their flanking exon-intron boundaries, and identified 20 novel and 3 previously reported heterozygous missense mutations in 25 of the 27 CCD patients (93%), which is a much higher mutation detection rate than that perceived previously. Among them, six were located outside the known 'hot spots'. Sixteen of 27 (59%) CCD patients had mutations in the C-terminal 'hot spot'. Three CCD patients had a probable autosomal recessive disease with two heterozygous mutations. Patients with C-terminal mutations had earlier onset and rather consistent muscle pathology characterized by the presence of distinct cores in almost all type 1 fibres, interstitial fibrosis and type 2 fibre deficiency. In contrast, patients with mutations outside the C-terminal region had milder clinical phenotype and harbour more atypical cores in their muscle fibres. We also sequenced two genes encoding RYR1-associated proteins as candidate causative genes for CCD: the 12 kD FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and the alpha1 subunit of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S). However, no mutation was found, suggesting that these genes may not, or only rarely, be responsible for CCD. Our results indicate that CCD may be caused by RYR1 mutations in the majority of patients.

23222517|t|Seventy-five genetic loci influencing the human red blood cell.
23222517|a|Anaemia is a chief determinant of global ill health, contributing to cognitive impairment, growth retardation and impaired physical capacity. To understand further the genetic factors influencing red blood cells, we carried out a genome-wide association study of haemoglobin concentration and related parameters in up to 135,367 individuals. Here we identify 75 independent genetic loci associated with one or more red blood cell phenotypes at P < 10(-8), which together explain 4-9% of the phenotypic variance per trait. Using expression quantitative trait loci and bioinformatic strategies, we identify 121 candidate genes enriched in functions relevant to red blood cell biology. The candidate genes are expressed preferentially in red blood cell precursors, and 43 have haematopoietic phenotypes in Mus musculus or Drosophila melanogaster. Through open-chromatin and coding-variant analyses we identify potential causal genetic variants at 41 loci. Our findings provide extensive new insights into genetic mechanisms and biological pathways controlling red blood cell formation and function.

20112382|t|Confirmation of an association between rs6822844 at the Il2-Il21 region and multiple autoimmune diseases: evidence of a general susceptibility locus.
20112382|a|Autoimmune diseases often have susceptibility genes in common, indicating similar molecular mechanisms. Increasing evidence suggests that rs6822844 at the IL2-IL21 region is strongly associated with multiple autoimmune diseases in individuals of European descent. This study was undertaken to attempt to replicate the association between rs6822844 and 6 different immune-mediated diseases in non-European populations, and to perform disease-specific and overall meta-analyses using data from previously published studies.We evaluated case-control associations between rs6822844 and celiac disease (CD) in subjects from Argentina; rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in subjects from Colombia; and Behçet's disease (BD) in subjects from Turkey. Allele and gene distributions were compared between cases and controls. Meta-analyses were performed using data from the present study and previous studies.We detected significant associations of rs6822844 with SLE (P = 0.008), type 1 DM (P = 0.014), RA (P = 0.019), and primary SS (P = 0.033) but not with BD (P = 0.34) or CD (P = 0.98). We identified little evidence of population differentiation (F(ST) = 0.01) within cases and controls from Argentina and Colombia, suggesting that association was not influenced by population substructure. Disease-specific meta-analysis indicated significant association for RA (P(meta) = 3.61 x 10(-6)), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) (P(meta) = 3.48 x 10(-12)), type 1 DM (P(meta) = 5.33 x 10(-5)), and CD (P(meta) = 5.30 x 10(-3)). Overall meta-analysis across all autoimmune diseases reinforced association with rs6822844 (23 data sets; P(meta) = 2.61 x 10(-25), odds ratio 0.73 [95% confidence interval 0.69-0.78]).Our results indicate that there is an association between rs6822844 and multiple autoimmune diseases in non-European populations. Meta-analysis results strongly reinforce this robust association across multiple autoimmune diseases in both European-derived and non-European populations.

16737834|t|The frequent observation of evidence for nonsense-mediated decay in RNA from patients with carbamyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency.
16737834|a|CPSI deficiency is an inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the first, rate-determining enzyme of the urea cycle. Our mutation detection data from this disorder suggest that a significant number of mutant alleles cause RNA instability, most likely through the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. We identified 26 non-consanguinous CPSID patients with an available RNA source (liver tissue or cell line) and screened both genomic DNA and RNA for the identification and classification of mutations. Out of 52 total alleles screened from these patients, 21 (40%) have strong evidence for RNA processing mutations demonstrated by absent/minimal heterozygosity in patient cDNA sequences despite heterozygous genomic changes. These 21 alleles are a heterogenous group primarily composed of splicing defects and frameshifts that form premature termination codons which should subsequently elicit the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. This study provides evidence for the high prevalence of RNA instability mutations in genetic disease and underscores the importance of accounting for them in mutation-screening strategies.

26866668|t|Analysis of Toll-Like Receptor 2 Polymorphism (rs5743704) in Saudi Patients with Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.
26866668|a|To investigate whether the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs5743704 in the toll-like receptor 2 gene is associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or any of its clinical indices in a Saudi cohort.Ninety-five unrelated POAG cases and 95 controls of Saudi origin were genotyped utilizing a TaqMan(®) assay. The association between genotypes and various clinical indices important for POAG were investigated.The genotypic and allelic frequencies among cases were not significantly different when compared to controls. The minor allele frequency was 0.021 in cases and 0.011 in controls. No significant association was seen with intraocular pressure and cup/disc ratio. However, carriers of the C/A genotype had higher number of anti-glaucoma medications compared to controls (p = 0.04).SNP rs5773704 is not associated with POAG in a Saudi population. Despite sample size limitation, the association of the minor allele A with higher number of anti-glaucoma medications suggests a possible indirect role for this SNP in predicting disease severity.

21799727|t|Comprehensive analysis of 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydrogenase (ALAD) variants and renal cell carcinoma risk among individuals exposed to lead.
21799727|a|Epidemiologic studies are reporting associations between lead exposure and human cancers. A polymorphism in the 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) gene affects lead toxicokinetics and may modify the adverse effects of lead.The objective of this study was to evaluate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging the ALAD region among renal cancer cases and controls to determine whether genetic variation alters the relationship between lead and renal cancer. Occupational exposure to lead and risk of cancer was examined in a case-control study of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Comprehensive analysis of variation across the ALAD gene was assessed using a tagging SNP approach among 987 cases and 1298 controls. Occupational lead exposure was estimated using questionnaire-based exposure assessment and expert review. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression.The adjusted risk associated with the ALAD variant rs8177796(CT/TT) was increased (OR = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.05-1.73, p-value = 0.02) when compared to the major allele, regardless of lead exposure. Joint effects of lead and ALAD rs2761016 suggest an increased RCC risk for the homozygous wild-type and heterozygous alleles ((GG)OR = 2.68, 95%CI = 1.17-6.12, p = 0.01; (GA)OR = 1.79, 95%CI = 1.06-3.04 with an interaction approaching significance (p(int) = 0.06). No significant modification in RCC risk was observed for the functional variant rs1800435(K68N). Haplotype analysis identified a region associated with risk supporting tagging SNP results.A common genetic variation in ALAD may alter the risk of RCC overall, and among individuals occupationally exposed to lead. Further work in larger exposed populations is warranted to determine if ALAD modifies RCC risk associated with lead exposure.

27208204|t|Molecular findings from 537 individuals with inherited retinal disease.
27208204|a|Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous set of disorders, for which diagnostic second-generation sequencing (next-generation sequencing, NGS) services have been developed worldwide.We present the molecular findings of 537 individuals referred to a 105-gene diagnostic NGS test for IRDs. We assess the diagnostic yield, the spectrum of clinical referrals, the variant analysis burden and the genetic heterogeneity of IRD. We retrospectively analyse disease-causing variants, including an assessment of variant frequency in Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC).Individuals were referred from 10 clinically distinct classifications of IRD. Of the 4542 variants clinically analysed, we have reported 402 mutations as a cause or a potential cause of disease in 62 of the 105 genes surveyed. These variants account or likely account for the clinical diagnosis of IRD in 51% of the 537 referred individuals. 144 potentially disease-causing mutations were identified as novel at the time of clinical analysis, and we further demonstrate the segregation of known disease-causing variants among individuals with IRD. We show that clinically analysed variants indicated as rare in dbSNP and the Exome Variant Server remain rare in ExAC, and that genes discovered as a cause of IRD in the post-NGS era are rare causes of IRD in a population of clinically surveyed individuals.Our findings illustrate the continued powerful utility of custom-gene panel diagnostic NGS tests for IRD in the clinic, but suggest clear future avenues for increasing diagnostic yields.

22206016|t|Multiple analytical approaches reveal distinct gene-environment interactions in smokers and non smokers in lung cancer.
22206016|a|Complex disease such as cancer results from interactions of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Studying these factors singularly cannot explain the underlying pathogenetic mechanism of the disease. Multi-analytical approach, including logistic regression (LR), classification and regression tree (CART) and multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), was applied in 188 lung cancer cases and 290 controls to explore high order interactions among xenobiotic metabolizing genes and environmental risk factors. Smoking was identified as the predominant risk factor by all three analytical approaches. Individually, CYP1A1*2A polymorphism was significantly associated with increased lung cancer risk (OR = 1.69;95%CI = 1.11-2.59,p = 0.01), whereas EPHX1 Tyr113His and SULT1A1 Arg213His conferred reduced risk (OR = 0.40;95%CI = 0.25-0.65,p<0.001 and OR = 0.51;95%CI = 0.33-0.78,p = 0.002 respectively). In smokers, EPHX1 Tyr113His and SULT1A1 Arg213His polymorphisms reduced the risk of lung cancer, whereas CYP1A1*2A, CYP1A1*2C and GSTP1 Ile105Val imparted increased risk in non-smokers only. While exploring non-linear interactions through CART analysis, smokers carrying the combination of EPHX1 113TC (Tyr/His), SULT1A1 213GG (Arg/Arg) or AA (His/His) and GSTM1 null genotypes showed the highest risk for lung cancer (OR = 3.73;95%CI = 1.33-10.55,p = 0.006), whereas combined effect of CYP1A1*2A 6235CC or TC, SULT1A1 213GG (Arg/Arg) and betel quid chewing showed maximum risk in non-smokers (OR = 2.93;95%CI = 1.15-7.51,p = 0.01). MDR analysis identified two distinct predictor models for the risk of lung cancer in smokers (tobacco chewing, EPHX1 Tyr113His, and SULT1A1 Arg213His) and non-smokers (CYP1A1*2A, GSTP1 Ile105Val and SULT1A1 Arg213His) with testing balance accuracy (TBA) of 0.6436 and 0.6677 respectively. Interaction entropy interpretations of MDR results showed non-additive interactions of tobacco chewing with SULT1A1 Arg213His and EPHX1 Tyr113His in smokers and SULT1A1 Arg213His with GSTP1 Ile105Val and CYP1A1*2C in nonsmokers. These results identified distinct gene-gene and gene environment interactions in smokers and non-smokers, which confirms the importance of multifactorial interaction in risk assessment of lung cancer.

19443294|t|Mutational spectrum of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma in taiwan.
19443294|a|Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome, and > 95% of MEN 2 patients carry rearranged during transfection (RET) protooncogene mutants. We aimed to elucidate the genotype and phenotype relationship of RET proto-oncogene mutations in Taiwanese subjects with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).We genotyped the MEN-2-associated germ-line mutations by PCR-based sequencing of the RET gene. DNA was extracted from a total of 69 members from eight unrelated families with individuals affected by MTC, and from seven sporadic cases of MTC.RET mutations were found in four MEN 2A families, all at codon 634 (one with C>R, two with C>F, and one with C>W). One MEN 2A patient carried a de novo mutation at codon 634 (C>R). In two families of MEN 2B, all carried the mutation at codon 918 (M>T). These two cases of MEN 2B were all de novo mutations. One family of familial MTC or unclassified MEN 2 carried the codon 620 (C>F) mutation. Among the seven sporadic cases of MTC, none was found to carry any mutation in hotspot exons. Only two non-synonymous variants (T278N/exon 4 and D489N/exon 7) were found in two cases. However, these two variants were not uncommon in our elderly population.We found that all eight MTC patients with a family history or with the other phenotypes of MEN 2 had RET mutations, whereas no significant RET mutation was found in seven patients with isolated MTC without family history and other endocrine diseases. Molecular scanning of the RET gene in MEN 2 and MTC in Taiwanese patients probably should be limited to exons 10, 11 and 16, initially to be cost-effective.

16571647|t|The molecular genetics of Marfan syndrome and related disorders.
16571647|a|Marfan syndrome (MFS), a relatively common autosomal dominant hereditary disorder of connective tissue with prominent manifestations in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems, is caused by mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1). The leading cause of premature death in untreated individuals with MFS is acute aortic dissection, which often follows a period of progressive dilatation of the ascending aorta. Recent research on the molecular physiology of fibrillin and the pathophysiology of MFS and related disorders has changed our understanding of this disorder by demonstrating changes in growth factor signalling and in matrix-cell interactions. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the molecular biology of fibrillin and fibrillin-rich microfibrils. Mutations in FBN1 and other genes found in MFS and related disorders will be discussed, and novel concepts concerning the complex and multiple mechanisms of the pathogenesis of MFS will be explained.

1714904|t|Missense mutation serine106----proline causes 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency.
1714904|a|Steroid 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by defects in cytochrome P450c17, the single enzyme that has 17-alpha hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities. We describe a rapid and efficient polymerase chain reaction tactic for identifying these genetic lesions and identify Ser106----Pro as the cause of 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency in two unrelated homozygous patients from Guam. We used site-directed mutagenesis of the normal P450c17 cDNA to construct the Pro106 mutant, and expressed both the normal and mutant sequences in monkey COS-1 cells and in yeast. Expression of the normal sequence permitted the cells to convert pregnenolone to 17-OH pregnenolone, progesterone to 17-OH progesterone, and 17-OH pregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone, showing the normal sequence conferred both 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities. Expression of the mutant sequence generated P450c17 mRNA, but conferred none of these activities, proving that the Ser106----Pro mutation abolished the 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities. An HhaI restriction site created by the mutation should permit screening of large populations.

22962670|t|Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline.
22962670|a|The aim was to develop clinical practice guidelines on hypertriglyceridemia.The Task Force included a chair selected by The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), five additional experts in the field, and a methodologist. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration.Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence, e-mail discussion, conference calls, and one in-person meeting. The guidelines were reviewed and approved sequentially by The Endocrine Society's CGS and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.The Task Force recommends that the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia be based on fasting levels, that mild and moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of 150-999 mg/dl) be diagnosed to aid in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, and that severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of > 1000 mg/dl) be considered a risk for pancreatitis. The Task Force also recommends that patients with hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for secondary causes of hyperlipidemia and that subjects with primary hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for family history of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. The Task Force recommends that the treatment goal in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in agreement with National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines. The initial treatment should be lifestyle therapy; a combination of diet modification and drug therapy may also be considered. In patients with severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia, a fibrate should be used as a first-line agent.

23817569|t|A genome-wide association meta-analysis of self-reported allergy identifies shared and allergy-specific susceptibility loci.
23817569|a|Allergic disease is very common and carries substantial public-health burdens. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide associations with self-reported cat, dust-mite and pollen allergies in 53,862 individuals. We used generalized estimating equations to model shared and allergy-specific genetic effects. We identified 16 shared susceptibility loci with association P<5×10(-8), including 8 loci previously associated with asthma, as well as 4p14 near TLR1, TLR6 and TLR10 (rs2101521, P=5.3×10(-21)); 6p21.33 near HLA-C and MICA (rs9266772, P=3.2×10(-12)); 5p13.1 near PTGER4 (rs7720838, P=8.2×10(-11)); 2q33.1 in PLCL1 (rs10497813, P=6.1×10(-10)), 3q28 in LPP (rs9860547, P=1.2×10(-9)); 20q13.2 in NFATC2 (rs6021270, P=6.9×10(-9)), 4q27 in ADAD1 (rs17388568, P=3.9×10(-8)); and 14q21.1 near FOXA1 and TTC6 (rs1998359, P=4.8×10(-8)). We identified one locus with substantial evidence of differences in effects across allergies at 6p21.32 in the class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region (rs17533090, P=1.7×10(-12)), which was strongly associated with cat allergy. Our study sheds new light on the shared etiology of immune and autoimmune disease.

19789204|t|Recessive isolated growth hormone deficiency and mutations in the ghrelin receptor.
19789204|a|Both GH releasing- and orexigenic properties of the gut-to-brain hormone ghrelin are mediated by the GH secretagogue receptor (GHSR). Recently in several patients, a missense mutation (p.A204E) resulting in a complete loss of GHSR constitutive activity has been implicated in short stature with dominant transmission.The objective of the study was to describe the phenotype associated with partial isolated GH deficiency of a young patient born to unrelated parents and identify the molecular basis of his disease.The growth delay (-3.0 sd) was associated with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, vomiting, ketosis, hypoglycemia, and a low body mass index. GHSR sequencing revealed that the patient was compound heterozygous for two new defects: 1) an early occurring transition predicting a premature stop codon (c.6G>A, p.W2X) inherited from his unaffected father, therefore strongly arguing against haploinsufficiency as a disease mechanism, and 2) a missense mutation (c.709A>T, p.R237W) inherited from his healthy mother, involving an evolutionary invariant residue from the third intracellular loop. In vitro experiments showed that the p.R237W mutation would result in a partial loss of constitutive activity of the receptor, whereas both its ability to respond to ghrelin and its cell surface expression are preserved.These data, which describe the first case of recessive partial isolated GH deficiency due to GHSR mutations and emphasize the physiological importance of the GHSR in somatic growth, are discussed in light of the dominantly expressed p.A204E mutation.

24084575|t|The MLH1 c.-27C>A and c.85G>T variants are linked to dominantly inherited MLH1 epimutation and are borne on a European ancestral haplotype.
24084575|a|Germline mutations of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2, and deletions affecting the EPCAM gene adjacent to MSH2, underlie Lynch syndrome by predisposing to early-onset colorectal, endometrial and other cancers. An alternative but rare cause of Lynch syndrome is constitutional epimutation of MLH1, whereby promoter methylation and transcriptional silencing of one allele occurs throughout normal tissues. A dominantly transmitted constitutional MLH1 epimutation has been linked to an MLH1 haplotype bearing two single-nucleotide variants, NM_000249.2: c.-27C>A and c.85G>T, in a Caucasian family with Lynch syndrome from Western Australia. Subsequently, a second seemingly unrelated Caucasian Australian case with the same MLH1 haplotype and concomitant epimutation was reported. We now describe three additional, ostensibly unrelated, cancer-affected families of European heritage with this MLH1 haplotype in association with constitutional epimutation, bringing the number of index cases reported to five. Array-based genotyping in four of these families revealed shared haplotypes between individual families that extended across ≤2.6-≤6.4 megabase regions of chromosome 3p, indicating common ancestry. A minimal ≤2.6 megabase founder haplotype common to all four families was identified, which encompassed MLH1 and additional flanking genes and segregated with the MLH1 epimutation in each family. Our findings indicate that the MLH1 c.-27C>A and c.85G>T variants are borne on a European ancestral haplotype and provide conclusive evidence for its pathogenicity via a mechanism of epigenetic silencing of MLH1 within normal tissues. Additional descendants bearing this founder haplotype may exist who are also at high risk of developing Lynch syndrome-related cancers. 

24914498|t|Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome with a DKC1 mutation identified by whole-exome sequencing.
24914498|a|Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome is a severe multisystem disorder that is characterized by bone-marrow failure, intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, immunodeficiency, and cerebellar atrophy. This rare disease shares clinical features with dyskeratosis congenita and, together, they are recognized as a group of disorders caused by telomere dysfunction. As the genetic background of dyskeratosis congenita or Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome has expanded rapidly, multiple causative genes and inheritance patterns pose a great challenge to their genetic diagnosis.A 3-month-old boy was referred for head titubation and tremulous movements of the trunk. Multiple petechiae also developed on his face and trunk at the age of 5 months. Extensive evaluation, including brain magnetic resonance imaging, hematologic tests, and bone-marrow evaluation, revealed cerebellar atrophy and aplastic anemia. His elder brother exhibited a similar clinical presentation and died from sepsis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Although skin pigmentation or nail dystrophy was not evident, Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome was suggested as a differential diagnosis. Instead of the conventional gene-specific approach with Sanger sequencing, we used whole-exome sequencing for the genetic diagnosis of this patient with possible Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome and successfully identified a missense mutation (c.146C>T, p.Thr49Me) in DKC1.This case suggests that whole-exome sequencing is particularly useful for the genetic diagnosis of extremely rare diseases with genetic heterogeneity, although there are many limitations, including cost and uneven or suboptimal coverage, to the application of this method as a routine genetic diagnosis.

22337906|t|An atypical case of familial glucocorticoid deficiency without pigmentation caused by coexistent homozygous mutations in MC2R (T152K) and MC1R (R160W).
22337906|a|Familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by isolated cortisol deficiency. Mutations in the gene encoding the ACTH receptor (MC2R) account for 25% of cases. One significant feature is generalized skin hyperpigmentation, which is thought to be due to elevated ACTH acting on the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R).The aim of the study was to determine the cause of a nonhyperpigmented case of FGD.The patient presented at 4 yr of age with hypoglycemia after prolonged fasting during a respiratory tract infection. She had further hypoglycemic attacks and was diagnosed with isolated glucocorticoid deficiency at 6 yr of age. Her parents were consanguineous, and she had two unaffected sisters. Her physical examination was normal, except that her height and weight were greater than the 97th centile for a sex- and age-matched reference population. Interestingly, she had no hyperpigmentation despite very high ACTH levels.Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed homozygous mutations c.478C>T in MC1R and c.455C>A in MC2R leading to R160W and T152K changes in the amino acid sequences, respectively. The R160W MC1R change has previously been implicated in a red hair/pale skin phenotype, and MC2R -T152K is trafficking defective. Both parents and two unaffected sisters were heterozygous for the MC1R mutation; additionally, one unaffected sister was heterozygous for the MC2R mutation, and the other was wild-type.We report an unusual case of FGD without hyperpigmentation due to coexistent MC1R/MC2R mutations. This case is important because it demonstrates for the first time that the assumption that the action of ACTH on MC1R causes skin hyperpigmentation is correct.

20921462|t|Randomized phase III study of panitumumab with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) compared with FOLFIRI alone as second-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
20921462|a|Panitumumab is a fully human anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody that improves progression-free survival (PFS) in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of panitumumab plus fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) compared with FOLFIRI alone after failure of initial treatment for mCRC by tumor KRAS status.Patients with mCRC, one prior chemotherapy regimen for mCRC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, and available tumor tissue for biomarker testing were randomly assigned 1:1 to panitumumab 6.0 mg/kg plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI every 2 weeks. The coprimary end points of PFS and overall survival (OS) were independently tested and prospectively analyzed by KRAS status.From June 2006 to March 2008, 1,186 patients were randomly assigned 1:1 and received treatment. KRAS status was available for 91% of patients: 597 (55%) with wild-type (WT) KRAS tumors, and 486 (45%) with mutant (MT) KRAS tumors. In the WT KRAS subpopulation, when panitumumab was added to chemotherapy, a significant improvement in PFS was observed (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.90; P = .004); median PFS was 5.9 months for panitumumab-FOLFIRI versus 3.9 months for FOLFIRI. A nonsignificant trend toward increased OS was observed; median OS was 14.5 months versus 12.5 months, respectively (HR = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.04; P = .12); response rate was improved to 35% versus 10% with the addition of panitumumab. In patients with MT KRAS, there was no difference in efficacy. Adverse event rates were generally comparable across arms with the exception of known toxicities associated with anti-EGFR therapy.Panitumumab plus FOLFIRI significantly improved PFS and is well-tolerated as second-line treatment in patients with WT KRAS mCRC.

20463881|t|Digital quantification of human eye color highlights genetic association of three new loci.
20463881|a|Previous studies have successfully identified genetic variants in several genes associated with human iris (eye) color; however, they all used simplified categorical trait information. Here, we quantified continuous eye color variation into hue and saturation values using high-resolution digital full-eye photographs and conducted a genome-wide association study on 5,951 Dutch Europeans from the Rotterdam Study. Three new regions, 1q42.3, 17q25.3, and 21q22.13, were highlighted meeting the criterion for genome-wide statistically significant association. The latter two loci were replicated in 2,261 individuals from the UK and in 1,282 from Australia. The LYST gene at 1q42.3 and the DSCR9 gene at 21q22.13 serve as promising functional candidates. A model for predicting quantitative eye colors explained over 50% of trait variance in the Rotterdam Study. Over all our data exemplify that fine phenotyping is a useful strategy for finding genes involved in human complex traits.

23954377|t|Familial hemiplegic migraine mutations affect Na,K-ATPase domain interactions.
23954377|a|Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is a monogenic variant of migraine with aura. One of the three known causative genes, ATP1A2, which encodes the α2 isoform of Na,K-ATPase, causes FHM type 2 (FHM2). Over 50 FHM2 mutations have been reported, but most have not been characterized functionally. Here we study the molecular mechanism of Na,K-ATPase α2 missense mutations. Mutants E700K and P786L inactivate or strongly reduce enzyme activity. Glutamic acid 700 is located in the phosphorylation (P) domain and the mutation most likely disrupts the salt bridge with Lysine 35, thereby destabilizing the interaction with the actuator (A) domain. Mutants G900R and E902K are present in the extracellular loop at the interface of the α and β subunit. Both mutants likely hamper the interaction between these subunits and thereby decrease enzyme activity. Mutants E174K, R548C and R548H reduce the Na(+) and increase the K(+) affinity. Glutamic acid 174 is present in the A domain and might form a salt bridge with Lysine 432 in the nucleotide binding (N) domain, whereas Arginine 548, which is located in the N domain, forms a salt bridge with Glutamine 219 in the A domain. In the catalytic cycle, the interactions of the A and N domains affect the K(+) and Na(+) affinities, as observed with these mutants. Functional consequences were not observed for ATP1A2 mutations found in two sporadic hemiplegic migraine cases (Y9N and R879Q) and in migraine without aura (R51H and C702Y). 

18252757|t|Analyses of a novel SCN5A mutation (C1850S): conduction vs. repolarization disorder hypotheses in the Brugada syndrome.
18252757|a|Brugada syndrome (BrS) is characterized by arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. BrS is caused, in part, by mutations in the SCN5A gene, which encodes the sodium channel alpha-subunit Na(v)1.5. Here, we aimed to characterize the biophysical properties and consequences of a novel BrS SCN5A mutation.SCN5A was screened for mutations in a male patient with type-1 BrS pattern ECG. Wild-type (WT) and mutant Na(v)1.5 channels were expressed in HEK293 cells. Sodium currents (I(Na)) were analysed using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique at 37 degrees C. The electrophysiological effects of the mutation were simulated using the Luo-Rudy model, into which the transient outward current (I(to)) was incorporated. A new mutation (C1850S) was identified in the Na(v)1.5 C-terminal domain. In HEK293 cells, mutant I(Na) density was decreased by 62% at -20 mV. Inactivation of mutant I(Na) was accelerated in a voltage-dependent manner and the steady-state inactivation curve was shifted by 11.6 mV towards negative potentials. No change was observed regarding activation characteristics. Altogether, these biophysical alterations decreased the availability of I(Na). In the simulations, the I(to) density necessary to precipitate repolarization differed minimally between the two genotypes. In contrast, the mutation greatly affected conduction across a structural heterogeneity and precipitated conduction block.Our data confirm that mutations of the C-terminal domain of Na(v)1.5 alter the inactivation of the channel and support the notion that conduction alterations may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of BrS.

25673413|t|Genetic studies of body mass index yield new insights for obesity biology.
25673413|a|Obesity is heritable and predisposes to many diseases. To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P < 5 × 10(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for ∼2.7% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for >20% of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis. 

20673819|t|Two cases of Noonan syndrome with severe respiratory and gastroenteral involvement and the SOS1 mutation F623I.
20673819|a|Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant, inherited disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism, congenital heart defects, and reduced postnatal growth. Dysregulated RAS-MAPK signalling is the common molecular basis for NS, a genetically heterogeneous disease. Germline mutations in genes encoding small GTPases of the RAS family (KRAS and NRAS), modulators of RAS function (PTPN11, SOS1 and SHOC2) or downstream signal transducers (RAF1) are causative for NS. SOS1 is the second major gene for NS after PTPN11. Compared to patients with mutations in other genes, SOS1 mutation-positive individuals in general tend to have a more favorable outcome, with less short stature and cognitive impairment. We describe two unrelated patients with NS carrying the same heterozygous SOS1 missense mutation (c.1867T > A/p.F623I). The phenotype of both patients is remarkable as they show uncommon clinical features such as pulmonary lymphangiectasis, congenital pleural effusions, severe feeding problems, and laryngomalacia. These findings may be related to the specific mutation present in our two patients, or be part of the SOS1 phenotype. Detailed clinical assessment of large cohorts of patients with NS and SOS1 mutation is required to clarify this initial observation.

10807542|t|Genetic alteration of the DCX gene in Japanese patients with subcortical laminar heterotopia or isolated lissencephaly sequence.
10807542|a|We examined mutations of the doublecortin (DCX) gene, which is responsible for X-linked subcortical laminar heterotopia (SCLH) and lissencephaly, in eight unrelated Japanese patients, four with SCLH and four with isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) disclosed a deletion of part of the DCX gene in one male ILS patient. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and subsequent sequence analysis were carried out in the remaining seven patients. One male ILS patient had a nonsense mutation in exon V, which would result in premature termination of the gene product. One female SCLH patient had a missense mutation in exon IV. Our results indicate that in the Japanese, as has been seen elsewhere, abnormality of the DCX gene is the common cause of SCLH and ILS.

19398669|t|MTHFR 677 C>T Polymorphism reveals functional importance for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, not homocysteine, in regulation of vascular redox state and endothelial function in human atherosclerosis.
19398669|a|The role of circulating homocysteine as an atherosclerosis risk factor has recently been questioned. However, 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), the circulating metabolite of folic acid participating in homocysteine metabolism, has direct effects on vascular function. We sought to distinguish the effects of plasma versus vascular tissue 5-MTHF and homocysteine on vascular redox and endothelial nitric oxide bioavailability in human vessels.We used the methyl tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism 677C>T as a model of chronic exposure of the vascular wall to varying 5-MTHF levels in 218 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Vascular superoxide, vascular 5-MTHF, and total homocysteine were determined in saphenous veins and internal mammary arteries obtained during surgery. Nitric oxide bioavailability was evaluated by organ bath studies on saphenous vein rings. MTHFR genotype was a determinant of vascular 5-MTHF (not vascular homocysteine). Both MTHFR genotype and vascular 5-MTHF were associated with vascular nitric oxide bioavailability and superoxide generated by uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase. In contrast, vascular homocysteine was associated only with NADPH-stimulated superoxide.Genetic polymorphism 677 C>T on MTHFR affects vascular 5-MTHF (but not homocysteine) and can be used as a model to distinguish the chronic effects of vascular 5-MTHF from homocysteine on vascular wall. Vascular 5-MTHF, rather than plasma or vascular homocysteine, is a key regulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase coupling and nitric oxide bioavailability in human vessels, suggesting that plasma homocysteine is an indirect marker of 5-MTHF rather than a primary regulator of endothelial function.

16941484|t|ATM mutations in Italian families with ataxia telangiectasia include two distinct large genomic deletions.
16941484|a|In patients affected by Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T), mutations in the ATM gene lead to loss-of-function alleles. Nonsense, splice-site variants, small insertions or deletions (frameshifts) and missense are the most commonly found mutations. Large genomic deletions (LGDs) are rare (approximately 1%) but can lead to the same phenotype. In compound heterozygotes, deletions are not detected by most screening strategies. We analysed the ATM gene in 12 unrelated Italian A-T patients and identified all 24 mutated alleles. Twelve mutations were novel. Standardized SNP and STR haplotyping followed by DHPLC screening of genomic DNA, allowed all but three mutations to be detected (approximately 87.5%). The remaining mutations required RT-PCR analysis of ATM transcript and Southern blotting of genomic DNA. We found three LGDs: one of 8.5 and two identical of 18 kb spanning exons 32-36 and 21-29, respectively. The breakpoints of these deletions were sequenced in an attempt to understand the mechanisms of mutations; both deletions involved regions rich in repeated elements.

28821231|t|Novel mutations in PANK2 and PLA2G6 genes in patients with neurodegenerative disorders: two case reports.
28821231|a|Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders associated with progressive impairment of movement, vision, and cognition. The disease is initially diagnosed on the basis of changes in brain magnetic resonance imaging which indicate an abnormal brain iron accumulation in the basal ganglia. However, the diagnosis of specific types should be based on both clinical findings and molecular genetic testing for genes associated with different types of NBIA, including PANK2, PLA2G6, C19orf12, FA2H, ATP13A2, WDR45, COASY, FTL, CP, and DCAF17. The purpose of this study was to investigate disease-causing mutations in two patients with distinct NBIA disorders.Whole Exome sequencing using Next Generation Illumina Sequencing was used to enrich all exons of protein-coding genes as well as some other important genomic regions in these two affected patients. A deleterious homozygous four-nucleotide deletion causing frameshift deletion in PANK2 gene (c.1426_1429delATGA, p.M476 fs) was identified in an 8 years old girl with dystonia, bone fracture, muscle rigidity, abnormal movement, lack of coordination and chorea. In addition, our study revealed a novel missense mutation in PLA2G6 gene (c.3G > T:p.M1I) in one and half-year-old boy with muscle weakness and neurodevelopmental regression (speech, motor and cognition). The novel mutations were also confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the proband and their parents.Current study uncovered two rare novel mutations in PANK2 and PLA2G6 genes in patients with NBIA disorder and such studies may help to conduct genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis more accurately for individuals at the high risk of these types of disorders.

24444108|t|Whole exome sequencing detects homozygosity for ABCA4 p.Arg602Trp missense mutation in a pediatric patient with rapidly progressive retinal dystrophy.
24444108|a|A pediatric patient presented with rapidly progressive vision loss, nyctalopia and retinal dystrophy. This is the first report of homozygosity for the p.Arg602Trp mutation in the ABCA4 gene. The child became legally blind within a period of 2 years.An eight year-old Hispanic female presented with bilateral decreased vision following a febrile gastrointestinal illness with nausea and vomiting. Extensive workup involved pediatric infectious disease and rheumatology consultations.Initial visual acuity was 20/60 at distance and 20/30 at near in both eyes. Rapidly progressive vision loss occurred during a 2-year period resulting in visual acuities of 20/200 at distance in both eyes. Fundus exam disclosed attenuated vessels and multiple subretinal blister-like elevations. Optical coherence tomography showed far more lesions than were clinically evident with different levels of elevation. Autofluorescence imagery showed dramatic and widespread geographic areas of atrophy. The deposits that appeared drusen-like on clinical exam were hyperfluorescent, consistent with lipofuscin deposits containing A2e (N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine) indicative of RPE cell dysfunction. Electroretinography was consistent with cone dystrophy, with relative preservation of rod function. Blood analysis and rheumatology evaluation found no evidence of a diffuse post-infectious/inflammatory process. The unique and rapid progression of her subretinal blister-like lesions was documented by fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, autofluorescence imagery, and fundus photography. Family pedigree history disclosed consanguinity, her parents being first cousins. DNA analysis by whole exomic sequencing revealed homozygosity of p.Arg602Trp in the ABCA4 gene.The pediatric patient presented with a striking clinical appearance and dramatic rate of progression that was clinically more characteristic of an infectious or inflammatory process. This case expands the diverse range of phenotypes attributed to ABCA4 mutations and further supports the role of whole exome sequencing as a powerful new tool available to aid clinicians in establishing diagnosis for challenging cases.

25918834|t|Stress and Bronchodilator Response in Children with Asthma.
25918834|a|Stress is associated with asthma morbidity in Puerto Ricans (PRs), who have reduced bronchodilator response (BDR).To examine whether stress and/or a gene regulating anxiety (ADCYAP1R1) is associated with BDR in PR and non-PR children with asthma.This was a cross-sectional study of stress and BDR (percent change in FEV1 after BD) in 234 PRs ages 9-14 years with asthma. We assessed child stress using the Checklist of Children's Distress Symptoms, and maternal stress using the Perceived Stress Scale. Replication analyses were conducted in two cohorts. Polymorphisms in ADCYAP1R1 were genotyped in our study and six replication studies. Multivariable models of stress and BDR were adjusted for age, sex, income, environmental tobacco smoke, and use of inhaled corticosteroids.High child stress was associated with reduced BDR in three cohorts. PR children who were highly stressed (upper quartile, Checklist of Children's Distress Symptoms) and whose mothers had high stress (upper quartile, Perceived Stress Scale) had a BDR that was 10.2% (95% confidence interval, 6.1-14.2%) lower than children who had neither high stress nor a highly stressed mother. A polymorphism in ADCYAP1R1 (rs34548976) was associated with reduced BDR. This single-nucleotide polymorphism is associated with reduced expression of the gene for the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) in CD4(+) lymphocytes of subjects with asthma, and it affects brain connectivity of the amygdala and the insula (a biomarker of anxiety).High child stress and an ADCYAP1R1 single-nucleotide polymorphism are associated with reduced BDR in children with asthma. This is likely caused by down-regulation of ADRB2 in highly stressed children.

9272155|t|The long QT syndrome: a novel missense mutation in the S6 region of the KVLQT1 gene.
9272155|a|The Romano Ward long QT syndrome (LQTS) has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Patients suffer from syncopal attacks often resulting in sudden cardiac death. The main diagnostic parameter is a prolonged QT(c) interval as judged by electro-cardiographic investigation. LQTS is a genetically heterogeneous disease with four loci having been identified to date: chromosome 11p15.5 (LQT1), 7q35-36 (LQT2), 3p21-24 (LQT3) and 4q25-26 (LQT4). The corresponding genes code for potassium channels KVLQT1 (LQT1) and HERG (LQT2) and the sodium channel SCN5A (LQT3). The KVLQT1 gene is characterized by six transmembrane domains (S1-S6), a pore region situated between the S5 and S6 domains and a C-terminal domain accounting for approximately 60% of the channel. This domain is thought to be co-associated with another protein, viz. minK (minimal potassium channel). We have studied a Romano Ward family with several affected individuals showing a severe LQTS phenotype (syncopes and occurrence of sudden death). Most affected individuals had considerable prolongations of QT(c). By using haplotyping with a set of markers covering the four LQT loci, strong linkage was established to the LQT1 locus, whereas the other loci (LQT2, LQT3 and LQT4) could be excluded. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing were used to screen the KVLQT1 gene for mutations in the S1-S6 region, including the pore domain. We identified a Gly-216-Arg substitution in the S6 transmembrane domain of KVLQT1. The mutation was present in all affected family members but absent in normal control individuals, providing evidence that the mutated KVLQT1-gene product indeed caused LQTS in this family. The mutated KVLQT1-gene product thus probably results in a dominant negative suppression of channel activity.

25052705|t|The Brazilian founder mutation TP53 p.R337H is uncommon in Portuguese women diagnosed with breast cancer.
25052705|a|Since the first studies reporting the TP53 p.R337H mutation as founder mutation in Southern and Southeastern Brazil, there has been controversy on its origin. Preliminary analysis of a small subset of Brazilian mutation carriers revealed that the haplotype incided on a Caucasian background. The vast majority of carriers identified today reside in Brazil or, if identified in other countries, are Brazilian immigrants. To our knowledge, the only two exceptions of carriers without a recognizable link with Brazil are two European families, from Portugal and Germany. Haplotype analysis in the Portuguese family revealed the same haplotype identified in Brazilian individuals, but in the German family, a distinct haplotype was found. Knowing that a significant proportion of women with breast cancer (BC) in Southern Brazil are p.R337H carriers, we analyzed p.R337H in a Portuguese cohort of women diagnosed with this disease. Median age at diagnosis among the first 573 patients tested was 60 years and 100 (17.4%) patients had been diagnosed at or under the age of 45 years. Mutation screening failed to identify the mutation in the 573 patients tested. These results are in contrast with the mutation frequency observed in a study including 815 BC-affected women from Brazil, in which carrier frequencies of 12.1 and 5.1% in pre- and postmenopausal women were observed, respectively. These findings suggest that the Brazilian founder mutation p.R337H, the most frequent germline TP53 mutation reported to date, is not a common germline alteration in Portuguese women diagnosed with BC.

1590804|t|Leukocyte adhesion deficiency: identification of novel mutations in two Japanese patients with a severe form.
1590804|a|Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is a disorder with mutations of the gene for the beta subunit, a component common to three adhesion molecules; LFA-1, Mac-1 and p150,95. The molecular basis of the disorder was studied in two patients with its severe form. In the first patient, the mutant gene expressed an aberrant mRNA, 1.2 kb longer than usual, resulting from a G to A substitution at the splice donor site of a 1.2 kb intron. Several aberrantly spliced messages, arising from splicing at cryptic donor sites, were also identified. The beta subunit proteins deduced from the mRNA sequences lacked half the carboxyl terminal portion. In the second patient, the mutation was a G to A transition at nucleotide 454, which resulted in an Asp128 to Asn substitution of the beta subunit. The 128th Asp residue is located in a region crucial for the association with alpha subunits and strictly conserved among the integrin beta subunits so far analyzed.

21999818|t|A cluster of factor XI-deficient patients due to a new mutation (Ile 436 Lys) in northeastern Italy.
21999818|a|A new mutation (Ile 436 Lys) was found in a cluster of patients in northeastern Italy. The mutation was present in five patients at the homozygote level and in one patient as a compound heterozygote with an already known mutation namely Glu 117 stop. All these patients showed a mild bleeding tendency mainly associated with deliveries or surgery. The first two patients were two sisters, and their parents were consanguineous. The third patient was the only homozygote in the family, and parents apparently were not consanguineous. The fourth and fifth patients were a brother and a sister, and in this case too, parents were not consanguineous. The sixth patient, a compound heterozygote, negated also the existence of consanguinity between his parents. There were also seven heterozygotes among the family members of the patients homozygous for this new mutation (Ile 436 Lys). Finally, there were two heterozygotes for the Glu 117 stop mutation in the family of the sixth patient. The heterozygotes, regardless of the mutation, were asymptomatic. The Ile436Lys mutation is characterized by low factor XI activity and antigen, namely is a cross-reaction material negative form. Molecular modeling indicates that the Ile436Lys mutation causes a large conformational change within the 432-442 loop. No relation could be traced among the different families; however, all their ancestors were autochthonous of the same two small towns. Furthermore, no Jewish ancestry could be found. The close geographical area in which all these patients were found and the absence of the same mutation in the general population of the area strongly suggests a founder effect and that the mutation is responsible for the defect. The compound heterozygosis with the Glu 117 stop mutation, common among Jews, was not surprising because of the past strict ties of the Republic of Venice with the Middle East.

10436378|t|Identification of a new transthyretin variant (Ile49) in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and nonisotopic RNase cleavage assay.
10436378|a|Mutation of the transthyretin (TTR) plasma protein and gene in a Japanese patient with amyloid polyneuropathy was investigated by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and nonisotopic RNase cleavage assay (NIRCA), respectively. ESI-MS analysis showed normal TTR peaks and additionally a variant TTR with 12-dalton-higher molecular weight than normal TTR. NIRCA suggested that the mutation existed near either the 5' or 3' end of exon 3. Direct DNA sequencing revealed both a normal ACC (threonine) and a variant ATC (isoleucine) at codon 49, which was located near the 5' end of exon 3. The molecular weight shift of this mutation was 12 D, consistent with the result of ESI-MS.

16802107|t|Subclinical course of adult visceral Niemann-Pick type C1 disease. A rare or underdiagnosed disorder?
16802107|a|We present the third case of Niemann-Pick disease type C without neurological symptoms. The patient was a 53-year-old woman without significant prior health problems who died of acute pulmonary embolism. Autopsy findings of hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and ceroid-rich foam cells raised the suspicion of the visceral form of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (Niemann-Pick disease type B; NPB) or a much rarer disorder, variant adult visceral form of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). To verify the histopathological findings, SMPD1, NPC1 and NPC2 genes were analysed. Two novel sequence variants, c.1997G>A (S666N) and c.2882A>G (N961S) were detected in the NPC1 gene. No pathogenic sequence variants were found either in the SMPD1 gene mutated in NPB or in NPC2 gene. The pathogenicity of both NPC1 variants was supported by their location in regions important for the protein function. Both variations were not found in more than 300 control alleles. Identified sequence variations confirm the diagnosis of the extremely rare adult visceral form of Niemann-Pick disease type C, which is otherwise dominated by neurovisceral symptoms. Although only three patients have been reported, this (most probably underdiagnosed) form of NPC should be considered in differential diagnosis of isolated hepatosplenomegaly with foam cells in adulthood.

23430834|t|Stroke and Stroke-Like Symptoms in Patients with Mutations in the POLG1 Gene.
23430834|a|Introduction/Methods Mutations in POLG1, the gene encoding mitochondrial polymerase gamma (Polγ), have been associated with a number of well-characterized phenotypes. In this study, we report two cases of patients with biallelic POLG1 mutations and stroke. We also performed a review of the literature and report on all clinical studies of patients with POLG1 mutations in which stroke was described in the phenotype. For each patient, genotype and phenotype are reported.               Results Including our two patients, a total of 22 patients have been reported with POLG1 mutations and stroke. The average age of onset of stroke in these patients was 9 years with a range of 1-23 years. In cases where localization was reported, the occipital lobes were the primary location of the infarct. Mutations in the linker-linker or linker-polymerase domains were the most frequent genotype observed. Seizures (16/22) and hepatic dysfunction/failure (8/22) were the most commonly reported symptoms in the stroke cohort.               Conclusion This article raises an underrecognized point that patients with POLG1 mutations may suffer a cerebrovascular accident at a young age. The most common location of the infarction is in the occipital lobe. The presentation may be similar to MELAS and can be misdiagnosed as a migrainous stroke.

25534755|t|A genome-wide association study of autism using the Simons Simplex Collection: Does reducing phenotypic heterogeneity in autism increase genetic homogeneity?
25534755|a|Phenotypic heterogeneity in autism has long been conjectured to be a major hindrance to the discovery of genetic risk factors, leading to numerous attempts to stratify children based on phenotype to increase power of discovery studies. This approach, however, is based on the hypothesis that phenotypic heterogeneity closely maps to genetic variation, which has not been tested. Our study examines the impact of subphenotyping of a well-characterized autism spectrum disorder (ASD) sample on genetic homogeneity and the ability to discover common genetic variants conferring liability to ASD.Genome-wide genotypic data of 2576 families from the Simons Simplex Collection were analyzed in the overall sample and phenotypic subgroups defined on the basis of diagnosis, IQ, and symptom profiles. We conducted a family-based association study, as well as estimating heritability and evaluating allele scores for each phenotypic subgroup.Association analyses revealed no genome-wide significant association signal. Subphenotyping did not increase power substantially. Moreover, allele scores built from the most associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, based on the odds ratio in the full sample, predicted case status in subsets of the sample equally well and heritability estimates were very similar for all subgroups.In genome-wide association analysis of the Simons Simplex Collection sample, reducing phenotypic heterogeneity had at most a modest impact on genetic homogeneity. Our results are based on a relatively small sample, one with greater homogeneity than the entire population; if they apply more broadly, they imply that analysis of subphenotypes is not a productive path forward for discovering genetic risk variants in ASD.

29481669|t|Pathogenic CTC1 mutations cause global genome instabilities under replication stress.
29481669|a|Coats plus syndrome is a complex genetic disorder that can be caused by mutations in genes encoding the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complex, a conserved single-stranded DNA binding protein complex. Studies have demonstrated that mutations identified in Coats plus patients are defective in telomere maintenance, and concluded that Coats plus may be caused by telomere dysfunction. Recent studies have established that CST also plays an important role in countering replication stress and protecting the stability of genomic fragile sites. However, it is unclear whether instabilities at genomic regions may promote Coats plus development. Here, we characterize eleven reported disease-causing CTC1 missense and small deletion mutations in maintaining genome stability. Our results show that these mutations induce spontaneous chromosome breakage and severe chromosome fragmentation that are further elevated by replication stress, leading to global genome instabilities. These mutations abolish or reduce CST interaction with RAD51, disrupt RAD51 foci formation, and/or diminish binding to GC-rich genomic fragile sites under replication stress. Furthermore, CTC1 mutations limit cell proliferation under unstressed condition and significantly reduce clonal viability under replication stress. Results also suggest that the aa 600-989 region of CTC1 contains a RAD51-interacting domain. Our findings thus provide molecular evidence linking replication-associated genomic defects with CP disease pathology.

11734061|t|Discrimination of three mutational events that result in a disruption of the R122 primary autolysis site of the human cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography.
11734061|a|R122, the primary autolysis site of the human cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1), constitutes an important "self-destruct" or "fail-safe" defensive mechanism against premature trypsin activation within the pancreas. Disruption of this site by a missense mutation, R122H, was found to cause hereditary pancreatitis. In addition to a c.365G>A (CGC>CAC) single nucleotide substitution, a c.365 through 366GC>AT (CGC>CAT) gene conversion event in exon 3 of PRSS1 was also found to result in a R122H mutation. This imposes a serious concern on the genotyping of pancreatitis by a widely used polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay, which could only detect the commonest c.365G>A variant.DNA samples containing either the known c.365G>A or c.365 through 366GC>AT variant in exon 3 of PRSS1 were used as positive controls to establish a denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) assay.DHPLC could readily discriminate the two known different mutational events resulting in the R122H mutation. More importantly, under the same experimental conditions, it identified a further mutational event that also occurs in the R122 primary autolysis site but results in a different amino acid substitution: c.364C>T (CGC>TGC; R122C).A rapid, simple, and low-cost assay for detecting both the known and new mutations occuring in the R122 primary autolysis site of PRSS1 was established. In addition, the newly found R122C variant represents a likely pancreatitis-predisposing mutation.

16485124|t|Eight novel CARD15 variants detected by DNA sequence analysis of the CARD15 gene in 111 patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
16485124|a|We performed a limited DNA sequence analysis of the CARD15 gene in 89 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 19 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and three patients with indeterminate colitis (IC), who were heterozygous carriers of one of the common CARD15 mutations [c.2104C>T (p.R702W), c.2722G>C (p.G908R), or c.3019_3020insC (p.Leu1007fsX1008)], the c.2462+10A>C variant, or of a new amino acid substitution in the 3'-end of exon 4. CARD15 exons 4, 5, 6, 8, and 11 were amplified by PCR and completely sequenced, thereby theoretically covering 73.9% of the described CARD15 variants and 96.6% of the mutated alleles. Using this approach, eight novel amino acid substitutions [c.1171C>T (p.R391C), c.1387C>G (p.P463A), c.2138G>A (p.R713H), c.2278C>T (p.R760C), c.2368C>T (p.R790W), c.2371C>T (p.R791W), c.2475C>G (p.N825K), and c.2546C>T (p.A849V)] were detected in six CD and two IC patients, and one UC patient. A severe disease phenotype was observed especially in patients who are compound-heterozygous for a common and a novel CARD15 mutation.

15879175|t|A mutation in the TRPC6 cation channel causes familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
15879175|a|Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a kidney disorder of unknown etiology, and up to 20% of patients on dialysis have been diagnosed with it. Here we show that a large family with hereditary FSGS carries a missense mutation in the TRPC6 gene on chromosome 11q, encoding the ion-channel protein transient receptor potential cation channel 6 (TRPC6). The proline-to-glutamine substitution at position 112, which occurs in a highly conserved region of the protein, enhances TRPC6-mediated calcium signals in response to agonists such as angiotensin II and appears to alter the intracellular distribution of TRPC6 protein. Previous work has emphasized the importance of cytoskeletal and structural proteins in proteinuric kidney diseases. Our findings suggest an alternative mechanism for the pathogenesis of glomerular disease.

26722489|t|A meta-analysis of xeroderma pigmentosum gene D Ls751Gln polymorphism and susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma.
26722489|a|Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of most common malignant tumors worldwide, but with unclear mechanisms. Xeroderma pigmentosum gene D (XPD) is one important DNA damage repair gene and can be involved in protein mutation. Currently little has been known about XPD polymorphism and HCC susceptibility in Chinese people. This study used a meta-analysis approach to comprehensively investigate the correlation between XPD polymorphism and HCC susceptibility in Chinese population, based on previously published literatures. A computer retrieval system was used to collect all case-control studies about XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism and HCC susceptibility. Data in literatures were extracted for meta-analysis. After the primary screening, four independent studies, which were published in 3 English articles and one Chinese article, were recruited in this study. There were 1,717 samples included in all studies. Using Gln/Gln + Lys/Gln, Lys/Lys + Lys/Gln and Lys allels as the reference, HCC disease alleles including Lys/Lys, Gln/Gln and Gln had OR values (95% CI, I(2)) of 1.007 (0.657~4.672, 91%), 3.516 (0.220~20.661, 48%) and 3.225 (0.278~12.326, 84%), respectively. The polymorphism of XPD751 loci is closely correlated with primary HCC. Lys751Gln polymorphism of XPD gene can be used as one susceptibility factor for HCC. 

30236074|t|Mutation m.15923A>G in the MT-TT gene causes mild myopathy - case report of an adult-onset phenotype.
30236074|a|Only five patients have previously been reported to harbor mutations in the MT-TT gene encoding mitochondrial tRNA threonine. The m.15923A > G mutation has been found in three severely affected children. One of these patients died within days after birth and two had a phenotype of myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) in early childhood. We have now found the mutation in an adult patient with mild myopathy.The patient is a 64-year-old Finnish man, who developed bilateral ptosis, diplopia and exercise intolerance in his fifties. Family history was unremarkable. Muscle histology showed cytochrome c-oxidase (COX) negative and ragged red fibres. The m.15923A > G mutation heteroplasmy was 33% in the skeletal muscle and 2% in buccal epithelial cells. The mutation was undetectable in the blood. Single-fibre analysis was performed and COX-negative fibres had a substantially higher heteroplasmy of 92%, than the normal fibres in which it was 43%.We report the fourth patient with m. 15923A > G and with a remarkably milder phenotype than the previous three patients. Our findings and recent biochemical studies suggest that the mutation m.15923A > G is a definite disease-causing mutation. Our results also suggest that heteroplasmy of the m.15923A > G mutation correlates with the severity of the phenotype. This study expands the catalog of the phenotypes caused by mutations in mtDNA.

22051736|t|Association between 11 genetic polymorphisms in folate-metabolising genes and head and neck cancer risk.
22051736|a|Genetic polymorphisms in folate metabolism may affect the risk of head and neck cancer (HNSCC) due to its involvement in DNA methylation and synthesis. We conducted a case-control study (265 HNSCC cases and 466 non-cancer controls) to investigate associations of MTHFR C677T and A1298C, MTR A2756G, MTRR A66G, RFC1 A80G, MTHFD1 G1958A, CBS 844ins68, TC2 C776G and A67G, SHMT C1420T and BHMT G742A polymorphisms with HNSCC risk. Interactions between polymorphisms and survival time, tobacco and alcohol habits, age, gender and tumour staging (TNM classification) were evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis. We found that age ≥ 49 years (P<0.001), male gender (P=0.03), tobacco habit (P<0.001), MTHFR 1298AC/CC (P=0.028), MTR 2756AG/GG (P=0.010) and RFC1 80AG/GG (P=0.015) genotypes were associated with an increased risk of HNSCC. There were interactions between lower survival and CBS 844ins68 (P=0.005); age ≥ 49 years and MTR 2756 AG/GG (P=0.004) and RFC1 80AG/GG (P=0.006) genotypes; male gender and MTHFR 1298 AC/CC (P=0.030), MTR 2756 AG/GG (P=0.006) and RFC1 80 AG/GG (P=0.009); tobacco non-habit and MTHFD1 1958GA/AA (P=0.040); tobacco and MTHFR 1298 AC/CC (P=0.054) and MTR 2756 AG/GG (P=0.010); alcohol non-consume and RFC1 80 AG/GG (P=0.008) with HNSCC increased risk. MTHFR C677CT/TT genotypes were less frequently in advanced tumours (P=0.04). In conclusion, our data provide evidence that folate metabolism genetic polymorphisms associated with variables as advanced age, male gender, tobacco and alcohol increase HNSCC development; CBS 844ins68 and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms are associated with less survival time and advanced stage tumours, respectively.

16358218|t|Diversity and functional consequences of germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations in human disease.
16358218|a|Germline mutations in PTPN11, the gene encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, cause Noonan syndrome (NS) and the clinically related LEOPARD syndrome (LS), whereas somatic mutations in the same gene contribute to leukemogenesis. On the basis of our previously gathered genetic and biochemical data, we proposed a model that splits NS- and leukemia-associated PTPN11 mutations into two major classes of activating lesions with differential perturbing effects on development and hematopoiesis. To test this model, we investigated further the diversity of germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations, delineated the association of those mutations with disease, characterized biochemically a panel of mutant SHP-2 proteins recurring in NS, LS, and leukemia, and performed molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural effects of selected mutations. Our results document a strict correlation between the identity of the lesion and disease and demonstrate that NS-causative mutations have less potency for promoting SHP-2 gain of function than do leukemia-associated ones. Furthermore, we show that the recurrent LS-causing Y279C and T468M amino acid substitutions engender loss of SHP-2 catalytic activity, identifying a previously unrecognized behavior for this class of missense PTPN11 mutations.

29146897|t|GWAS for male-pattern baldness identifies 71 susceptibility loci explaining 38% of the risk.
29146897|a|Male pattern baldness (MPB) or androgenetic alopecia is one of the most common conditions affecting men, reaching a prevalence of ~50% by the age of 50; however, the known genes explain little of the heritability. Here, we present the results of a genome-wide association study including more than 70,000 men, identifying 71 independently replicated loci, of which 30 are novel. These loci explain 38% of the risk, suggesting that MPB is less genetically complex than other complex traits. We show that many of these loci contain genes that are relevant to the pathology and highlight pathways and functions underlying baldness. Finally, despite only showing genome-wide genetic correlation with height, pathway-specific genetic correlations are significant for traits including lifespan and cancer. Our study not only greatly increases the number of MPB loci, illuminating the genetic architecture, but also provides a new approach to disentangling the shared biological pathways underlying complex diseases.

18538294|t|Loss of function in phenylketonuria is caused by impaired molecular motions and conformational instability.
18538294|a|A significant share of patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency benefits from pharmacological doses of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), the natural PAH cofactor. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is hypothesized to be a conformational disease, with loss of function due to protein destabilization, and the restoration of enzyme function that is observed in BH(4) treatment might be transmitted by correction of protein misfolding. To elucidate the molecular basis of functional impairment in PAH deficiency, we investigated the impact of ten PAH gene mutations identified in patients with BH(4)-responsiveness on enzyme kinetics, stability, and conformation of the protein (F55L, I65S, H170Q, P275L, A300S, S310Y, P314S, R408W, Y414C, Y417H). Residual enzyme activity was generally high, but allostery was disturbed in almost all cases and pointed to altered protein conformation. This was confirmed by reduced proteolytic stability, impaired tetramer assembly or aggregation, increased hydrophobicity, and accelerated thermal unfolding--with particular impact on the regulatory domain--observed in most variants. Three-dimensional modeling revealed the involvement of functionally relevant amino acid networks that may communicate misfolding throughout the protein. Our results substantiate the view that PAH deficiency is a protein-misfolding disease in which global conformational changes hinder molecular motions essential for physiological enzyme function. Thus, PKU has evolved from a model of a genetic disease that leads to severe neurological impairment to a model of a treatable protein-folding disease with loss of function.

11499718|t|Development of left ventricular hypertrophy in adults in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by cardiac myosin-binding protein C gene mutations.
11499718|a|We sought to determine whether the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) can be demonstrated during adulthood in genetically affected relatives with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous cardiac disease caused by mutations in nine genes that encode proteins of the sarcomere. Mutations in cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MyBPC) gene have been associated with age-related penetrance.To further analyze dormancy of LVH in patients with HCM, we studied, using echocardiography and 12-lead electrocardiography, the phenotypic expression caused by MyBPC mutations in seven genotyped pedigrees.Of 119 family members studied, 61 were identified with a MyBPC mutation, including 21 genetically affected relatives (34%) who did not express the HCM morphologic phenotype (by virtue of showing normal left ventricular wall thickness). Of these 21 phenotype-negative individuals, 9 were children, presumably in the prehypertrophic phase, and 12 were adults. Of the 12 adults with normal wall thickness < or = 12 mm (7 also with normal electrocardiograms), 5 subsequently underwent serial echocardiography prospectively over four to six years. Of note, three of these five adults showed development of LVH in mid-life, appearing for the first time at 33, 34 and 42 years of age, respectively, not associated with outflow obstruction or significant symptoms.In adults with HCM, disease-causing MyBPC mutations are not uncommonly associated with absence of LVH on echocardiogram. Delayed remodeling with the development of LVH appearing de novo in adulthood, demonstrated here for the first time in individual patients with prospectively obtained serial echocardiograms, substantiates the principle of age-related penetrance for MyBPC mutations in HCM. These observations alter prevailing perceptions regarding the HCM clinical spectrum and family screening strategies and further characterize the evolution of LVH in this disease.

21211798|t|Association of a polymorphism of BTN2A1 with myocardial infarction in East Asian populations.
21211798|a|We have performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to myocardial infarction (MI) in Japanese and Korean populations.A total of 17,447 Japanese or Korean individuals from four independent subject panels was examined. Japanese subject panels A, B, and C comprised 134 individuals with MI and 137 controls, 1431 individuals with MI and 3161 controls, and 643 individuals with MI and 1347 controls, respectively, whereas the Korean population comprised 1880 individuals with MI and 8714 controls. A GWAS for MI was performed in Japanese subject panel A with the use of the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set.Seventy single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly (P<1.0×10(-7)) associated with MI by the GWAS were examined further in Japanese subject panel B, revealing two SNPs (rs6929846 of BTN2A1, rs2569512 of ILF3) to be significantly (P<0.0007) associated with MI. The rs6929846 SNP of BTN2A1, but not rs2569512 of ILF3, was also significantly associated with MI in Japanese subject panel C. However, the association of neither rs6929846 nor rs2569512 with MI was replicated in the Korean population.BTN2A1 may be a susceptibility gene for MI in Japanese individuals.

18596051|t|Polygenic determinants of severe hypertriglyceridemia.
18596051|a|Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified new genetic determinants of complex quantitative traits, including plasma triglyceride (TG). We hypothesized that common variants associated with mild TG variation identified in GWA studies would also be associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). We studied 132 patients of European ancestry with severe HTG (fasting plasma TG > 10 mmol/l), who had no mutations found by resequencing of candidate genes, and 351 matched normolipidemic controls. We determined genotypes for: GALNT2 rs4846914, TBL2/MLXIPL rs17145738, TRIB1 rs17321515, ANGPTL3 rs12130333, GCKR rs780094, APOA5 rs3135506 (S19W), APOA5 rs662799 (-1131T > C), APOE (isoforms) and LPL rs328 (S447X). We found that: (i) genotypes, including those of APOA5 S19W, APOA5 -1131T > C, APOE, GCKR, TRIB1 and TBL2/MLXIPL, were significantly associated with severe HTG; (ii) odds ratios for these genetic variables were significant in both univariate and multivariate regression analyses, irrespective of the presence or absence of diabetes or obesity; (iii) a significant fraction-about one-quarter-of the explained variation in disease status was associated with these genotypes. Therefore, common SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that are associated with mild TG variation in GWA studies of normolipidemic subjects are also associated with severe HTG. Our findings are consistent with the emerging model of a complex genetic trait. At the extremes of a quantitative trait, such as severe HTG, are found the cumulative contributions of both multiple rare alleles with large genetic effects and common alleles with small effects.

26634245|t|A genome-wide association study identifies risk loci for spirometric measures among smokers of European and African ancestry.
26634245|a|Pulmonary function decline is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality among smokers. Post bronchodilator FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio are considered the standard assessment of airflow obstruction. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 9919 current and former smokers in the COPDGene study (6659 non-Hispanic Whites [NHW] and 3260 African Americans [AA]) to identify associations with spirometric measures (post-bronchodilator FEV1 and FEV1/FVC). We also conducted meta-analysis of FEV1 and FEV1/FVC GWAS in the COPDGene, ECLIPSE, and GenKOLS cohorts (total n = 13,532).Among NHW in the COPDGene cohort, both measures of pulmonary function were significantly associated with SNPs at the 15q25 locus [containing CHRNA3/5, AGPHD1, IREB2, CHRNB4] (lowest p-value = 2.17 × 10(-11)), and FEV1/FVC was associated with a genomic region on chromosome 4 [upstream of HHIP] (lowest p-value = 5.94 × 10(-10)); both regions have been previously associated with COPD. For the meta-analysis, in addition to confirming associations to the regions near CHRNA3/5 and HHIP, genome-wide significant associations were identified for FEV1 on chromosome 1 [TGFB2] (p-value = 8.99 × 10(-9)), 9 [DBH] (p-value = 9.69 × 10(-9)) and 19 [CYP2A6/7] (p-value = 3.49 × 10(-8)) and for FEV1/FVC on chromosome 1 [TGFB2] (p-value = 8.99 × 10(-9)), 4 [FAM13A] (p-value = 3.88 × 10(-12)), 11 [MMP3/12] (p-value = 3.29 × 10(-10)) and 14 [RIN3] (p-value = 5.64 × 10(-9)).In a large genome-wide association study of lung function in smokers, we found genome-wide significant associations at several previously described loci with lung function or COPD. We additionally identified a novel genome-wide significant locus with FEV1 on chromosome 9 [DBH] in a meta-analysis of three study populations.

31667733|t|Increased 
31667733|a|Recently, the potential value of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation as a prognostic marker in glioblastomas has been established. Glioblastomas are classified by their IDH mutation status under the 2016 WHO classification system. However, noninvasive diagnostic methods for the mutation status in glioblastoma patients have not been established so far. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference of acetate metabolism between in glioblastomas with wild-type IDH and in those with IDH mutation by comparing the uptake of We established glioblastoma cells (U251) expressing IDH1 R132H and examined the cell uptake of [1-Significantly higher uptake of [1-In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the uptake of radiolabeled acetate was significantly higher in IDH-mutated cells than in IDH-wild-type cells.

17764108|t|Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes, ionizing radiation exposure and risk of breast cancer in U.S. Radiologic technologists.
17764108|a|High-dose ionizing radiation exposure to the breast and rare autosomal dominant genes have been linked with increased breast cancer risk, but the role of low-to-moderate doses from protracted radiation exposure in breast cancer risk and its potential modification by polymorphisms in DNA repair genes has not been previously investigated among large numbers of radiation-exposed women with detailed exposure data. Using carefully reconstructed estimates of cumulative breast doses from occupational and personal diagnostic ionizing radiation, we investigated the potential modification of radiation-related breast cancer risk by 55 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms in 17 genes involved in base excision or DNA double-strand break repair among 859 cases and 1083 controls from the United States Radiologic Technologists (USRT) cohort. In multivariable analyses, WRN V114I (rs2230009) significantly modified the association between cumulative occupational breast dose and risk of breast cancer (adjusted for personal diagnostic exposure) (p = 0.04) and BRCA1 D652N (rs4986850), PRKDC IVS15 + 6C > T (rs1231202), PRKDC IVS34 + 39T > C (rs8178097) and PRKDC IVS31 - 634C > A (rs10109984) significantly altered the personal diagnostic radiation exposure-response relationship (adjusted for occupational dose) (p < or = 0.05). None of the remaining 50 SNPs significantly modified breast cancer radiation dose-response relationships. The USRT genetic study provided a unique opportunity to examine the joint effects of common genetic variation and ionizing radiation exposure on breast cancer risk using detailed occupational and personal diagnostic exposure data. The suggestive evidence found for modification of radiation-related breast cancer risk for 5 of the 55 SNPs evaluated requires confirmation in larger studies of women with quantified radiation breast doses in the low-to-moderate range.

29482350|t|Tumor Protein p53 (TP53) Gene and Left Main Coronary Artery Disease.
29482350|a|Patients with left main (LM) coronary artery disease (CAD) are at the highest risk of cardiovascular events. We evaluated possible gene polymorphisms of tumor protein 53 ( TP53, rs1042522, p.Arg72Pro) that can differentiate LM-CAD from patients with more peripheral CAD (MP-CAD) and healthy participants (control group) in 520 individuals (LM-CAD, n = 175; MP-CAD, n = 185; and control group, n = 160). Patients with LM-CAD had the lowest Arg/Arg genotype frequency (36.0%) compared with the MP-CAD (57.3%) and control groups (61.9%), P < .001 for both comparisons. Similarly, the Arg allele was more frequent in the control group than in patients with MP-CAD (78.8% vs 73.2%; P = .007) and LM-CAD (78.8% vs 64.0%; P < .001). The Arg/Pro genotype was more frequent in the LM-CAD group compared with the MP-CAD and control groups (56.0, 31.9, and 33.8, respectively, P < .001 for both comparisons). Furthermore, the frequency of Arg/Arg genotypes was the lowest in the LM-CAD group compared with the MP-CAD and control groups. Knowing that TP53 is an antioncogene protein that acts as a tumor suppressor and regulator of apoptosis, the lowest frequency of Arg/Arg genotype observed in these high-risk patients may indicate lower protection from the atherosclerosis process. Replication studies are needed to evaluate this association.

23040497|t|Mutations in calmodulin cause ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death.
23040497|a|Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a devastating inherited disorder characterized by episodic syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural cardiac abnormalities. Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals. Mutations in RYR2, encoding the cardiac sarcoplasmic calcium channel, have been identified as causative in approximately half of all dominantly inherited CPVT cases. Applying a genome-wide linkage analysis in a large Swedish family with a severe dominantly inherited form of CPVT-like arrhythmias, we mapped the disease locus to chromosome 14q31-32. Sequencing CALM1 encoding calmodulin revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (c.161A>T [p.Asn53Ile]) segregating with the disease. A second, de novo, missense mutation (c.293A>G [p.Asn97Ser]) was subsequently identified in an individual of Iraqi origin; this individual was diagnosed with CPVT from a screening of 61 arrhythmia samples with no identified RYR2 mutations. Both CALM1 substitutions demonstrated compromised calcium binding, and p.Asn97Ser displayed an aberrant interaction with the RYR2 calmodulin-binding-domain peptide at low calcium concentrations. We conclude that calmodulin mutations can cause severe cardiac arrhythmia and that the calmodulin genes are candidates for genetic screening of individual cases and families with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and unexplained sudden cardiac death.

12111250|t|Barttin increases surface expression and changes current properties of ClC-K channels.
12111250|a|The term Bartter syndrome encompasses a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive salt-losing nephropathies that are caused by disturbed transepithelial sodium chloride reabsorption in the distal nephron. Mutations have been identified in the NKCC2 (Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-)) cotransporter and ROMK potassium channel, which cooperate in the process of apical sodium chloride uptake, and ClC-Kb chloride channels, which mediate basolateral chloride release. Recently, mutations in barttin, a protein not related to any known ion transporter or channel, were described in BSND, a variant of Bartter syndrome associated with sensorineural deafness. Here we show that barttin functions as an activator of ClC-K chloride channels. Expression of barttin together with ClC-K in Xenopus oocytes increased ClC-K current amplitude, changed ClC-K biophysical properties, and enhanced ClC-K abundance in the cell membrane. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed a direct interaction of barttin with ClC-K. We performed in situ hybridization on rat kidney slices and RT-PCR analysis on microdissected nephron segments to prove co-expression of barttin, ClC-K1 and ClC-K2 along the distal nephron. Functional analysis of BSND-associated point mutations revealed impaired ClC-K activation by barttin. The results demonstrate regulation of a CLC chloride channel by an accessory protein and indicate that ClC-K activation by barttin is required for adequate tubular salt reabsorption.

27061120|t|Novel de novo mutations in ZBTB20 in Primrose syndrome with congenital hypothyroidism.
27061120|a|The cardinal features of Primrose syndrome (MIM 259050) are dysmorphic facial features, macrocephaly, and intellectual disability, as well as large body size, height and weight, and calcified pinnae. A variety of neurological signs and symptoms have been reported including hearing loss, autism, behavioral abormalities, hypotonia, cerebral calcifications, and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Recently, heterozygous de novo missense mutations in ZBTB20, coding for a zing finger protein, have been identified in Primrose syndrome patients. We report a boy with intellectual disability carrying two de novo missense mutations in the last exon of ZBTB20 (Ser616Phe and Gly741Arg; both previously unreported). One of them, Ser616Phe, affects an amino acid located in one of the C2H2 zing-fingers involved in DNA-binding and close to other missense mutations already described. Reverse phenotyping showed that this patient presents with classic features of Primrose syndrome (dysmorphic facies, macrocephaly, hearing loss, hypotonia, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum) and, in addition, congenital hypothyroidism. Review of the literature reveals another Primrose syndrome patient with hypothyroidism and thus, this may represent an under recognized component that should be investigated in other patients. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

23315542|t|Heterogeneity of mutational mechanisms and modes of inheritance in auriculocondylar syndrome.
23315542|a|Auriculocondylar syndrome (ACS) is a rare craniofacial disorder consisting of micrognathia, mandibular condyle hypoplasia and a specific malformation of the ear at the junction between the lobe and helix. Missense heterozygous mutations in the phospholipase C, β 4 (PLCB4) and guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), α inhibiting activity polypeptide 3 (GNAI3) genes have recently been identified in ACS patients by exome sequencing. These genes are predicted to function within the G protein-coupled endothelin receptor pathway during craniofacial development.We report eight additional cases ascribed to PLCB4 or GNAI3 gene lesions, comprising six heterozygous PLCB4 missense mutations, one heterozygous GNAI3 missense mutation and one homozygous PLCB4 intragenic deletion. Certain residues represent mutational hotspots; of the total of 11 ACS PLCB4 missense mutations now described, five disrupt Arg621 and two disrupt Asp360. The narrow distribution of mutations within protein space suggests that the mutations may result in dominantly interfering proteins, rather than haploinsufficiency. The consanguineous parents of the patient with a homozygous PLCB4 deletion each harboured the heterozygous deletion, but did not present the ACS phenotype, further suggesting that ACS is not caused by PLCB4 haploinsufficiency. In addition to ACS, the patient harbouring a homozygous deletion presented with central apnoea, a phenotype that has not been previously reported in ACS patients.These findings indicate that ACS is not only genetically heterogeneous but also an autosomal dominant or recessive condition according to the nature of the PLCB4 gene lesion.

22306654|t|Common variants near MBNL1 and NKX2-5 are associated with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.
22306654|a|Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a severe condition characterized by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 1,001 surgery-confirmed cases and 2,401 controls from Denmark. The six most strongly associated loci were tested in a replication set of 796 cases and 876 controls. Three SNPs reached genome-wide significance. One of these SNPs, rs11712066 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.61; P = 1.5 × 10(-17)) at 3p25.1, is located 150 kb upstream of MBNL1, which encodes a factor that regulates splicing transitions occurring shortly after birth. The second SNP, rs573872 (OR = 1.41; P = 4.3 × 10(-12)), maps to an intergenic region at 3p25.2 approximately 1.3 Mb downstream of MBNL1. The third SNP, rs29784 (OR = 1.42; P = 1.5 × 10(-15)) at 5q35.2, is 64 kb downstream of NKX2-5, which is involved in development of cardiac muscle tissue and embryonic gut development.

30510241|t|Discovery of common and rare genetic risk variants for colorectal cancer.
30510241|a|To further dissect the genetic architecture of colorectal cancer (CRC), we performed whole-genome sequencing of 1,439 cases and 720 controls, imputed discovered sequence variants and Haplotype Reference Consortium panel variants into genome-wide association study data, and tested for association in 34,869 cases and 29,051 controls. Findings were followed up in an additional 23,262 cases and 38,296 controls. We discovered a strongly protective 0.3% frequency variant signal at CHD1. In a combined meta-analysis of 125,478 individuals, we identified 40 new independent signals at P < 5 × 10

26722403|t|A novel germline mutation in SDHA identified in a rare case of gastrointestinal stromal tumor complicated with renal cell carcinoma.
26722403|a|Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which is located on the mitochondrial inner membrane, is essential to the Krebs cycle. Mutations of the SDH gene are associated with many tumors, such as renal cell carcinoma, wild type gastrointestinal stromal tumors (WT GISTs) and hereditary paragangliomas/pheochromocytomas. Herein we present a rare case diagnosed as a WT GIST complicated with a renal chromophobe cell tumor and detected a novel germline heterozygous mutation (c.2T>C: p.M1T) in the initiation codon of the SDHA gene. We also conduct a preliminary exploration for the mechanism of reduced expression of SDHB without mutation of SDHB gene. Our case enriches the mutation spectrum of the SDH gene. After reviewing previous studies, we found it to be the first case diagnosed as a WT GIST complicated with a synchronous renal chromophobe cell tumor and identified a novel germline heterozygous mutation. It was also the second reported case of a renal cell carcinoma associated with an SDHA mutation. 

18540691|t|Glutathione S-transferase P1 Ile105Val polymorphism is associated with haematological toxicity in elderly rectal cancer patients receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy.
18540691|a|Increasing evidence suggests that common gene polymorphisms may influence the toxicity of various cytotoxic agents used in the treatment of cancer.To evaluate the predictive value of acute toxicity of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677T polymorphism, glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) substitution of isoleucine with valine at codon 105 (Ile105Val) polymorphism and the tandem repeat polymorphism in the thymidylate synthase gene promoter in elderly patients with rectal cancer receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT).From 1994 to 2002, 166 Caucasian patients underwent surgery following CRT for mid-low rectal cancer at a single institution, 42 (male-to-female ratio, 25 : 17) of whom were aged > or =65 years (median age 70 years, range 65-79). The pre-treatment clinical stage was tumour (T) stage 3-4 in 38 patients and node (N)-positive in 29 patients. Patients received external-beam radiotherapy with conventional fractionation and fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Blood samples were used to extract and amplify DNA. Gene polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion. Acute toxicity to preoperative therapy was reported according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance and linear regression, respectively.Haematological toxicity (grade 1-2) was observed in 15 of 40 patients for whom toxicity data were available and gastrointestinal toxicity (grade 1-4) in 24 of these same 40 patients. At univariate analysis, female sex (p = 0.036) and GSTP1 Ile105Val (p = 0.0376) were associated with haematological toxicity. At multivariate analysis, GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism (p = 0.041) was the only factor found to be associated with haematological toxicity. Patients carrying the Val/Val genotype in the GSTP1 gene had a lower risk of haematological toxicity (odds ratio = 0.322, 95% CI 0.101, 0.957) than patients with the Ile/Ile genotype.GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism is a promising marker of potential haematological toxicity in elderly patients with rectal cancer receiving preoperative CRT.

9600456|t|Two CPT2 mutations in three Japanese patients with carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency: functional analysis and association with polymorphic haplotypes and two clinical phenotypes.
9600456|a|Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency manifests as two different clinical phenotypes: a muscular form and a hepatic form. We have investigated three nonconsanguineous Japanese patients with CPT II deficiency. Molecular analysis revealed two missense mutations, a glutamate (174)-to-lysine substitution (E174K) and a phenylalanine (383)-to-tyrosine substitution (F383Y) in the CPT II cDNA. Transfection experiments in COS-1 cells demonstrated that the two mutations markedly decreased the catalytic activity of mutant CPT II. Case 1 (hepatic form) was homozygous for the F383Y mutation, whereas case 3 (muscular form) was homozygous for the E174K mutation. Case 2 and her brother, who were compound heterozygotes for E174K and F383Y, exhibited the hepatic phenotype. We also identified a novel polymorphism in the CPT2 gene, a phenylalanine (352)-to-cysteine substitution (F352C), which did not alter CPT II activity in transfected cells. It was present in 21 out of 100 normal alleles in the Japanese population, but absent in Caucasian populations. Genotyping with the F352C polymorphism and the two previously reported polymorphisms, V368I and M647V, allowed normal Japanese alleles to be classified into five haplotypes. In all three families with CPT II deficiency, the E174K mutation resided only on the F1V1M1 allele, whereas the F383Y mutation was observed on the F2V2M1 allele, suggesting a single origin for each mutation.

11301010|t|BACH1, a novel helicase-like protein, interacts directly with BRCA1 and contributes to its DNA repair function.
11301010|a|BRCA1 interacts in vivo with a novel protein, BACH1, a member of the DEAH helicase family. BACH1 binds directly to the BRCT repeats of BRCA1. A BACH1 derivative, bearing a mutation in a residue that was essential for catalytic function in other helicases, interfered with normal double-strand break repair in a manner that was dependent on its BRCA1 binding function. Thus, BACH1/BRCA1 complex formation contributes to a key BRCA1 activity. In addition, germline BACH1 mutations affecting the helicase domain were detected in two early-onset breast cancer patients and not in 200 matched controls. Thus, it is conceivable that, like BRCA1, BACH1 is a target of germline cancer-inducing mutations.

24483153|t|A novel point mutation of the human glucocorticoid receptor gene causes primary generalized glucocorticoid resistance through impaired interaction with the LXXLL motif of the p160 coactivators: dissociation of the transactivating and transreppressive activities.
24483153|a|Primary generalized glucocorticoid resistance is a rare genetic disorder characterized by generalized, partial, target-tissue insensitivity to glucocorticoids. The molecular basis of the condition has been ascribed to inactivating mutations in the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) gene.The objective of the study was to present three new cases caused by a novel mutation in the hGR gene and to delineate the molecular mechanisms through which the mutant receptor impairs glucocorticoid signal transduction.The index case (father) and his two daughters presented with increased urinary free cortisol excretion and resistance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to dexamethasone suppression in the absence of clinical manifestations suggestive of Cushing syndrome. All subjects harbored a novel, heterozygous, point mutation (T→G) at nucleotide position 1724 of the hGR gene, which resulted in substitution of valine by glycine at amino acid 575 of the receptor. Compared with the wild-type receptor, the hGRαV575G demonstrated a significant (33%) reduction in its ability to transactivate the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in response to dexamethasone, a 50% decrease in its affinity for the ligand, and a 2.5-fold delay in nuclear translocation. Although it did not exert a dominant negative effect on the wild-type receptor and preserved its ability to bind to DNA, hGRαV575G displayed significantly enhanced (∼80%) ability to transrepress the nuclear factor-κΒ signaling pathway. Finally, the mutant receptor hGRαV575G demonstrated impaired interaction with the LXXLL motif of the glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 coactivator in vitro and in computer-based structural simulation via its defective activation function-2 (AF-2) domain.The natural mutant receptor hGRαV575G causes primary generalized glucocorticoid resistance by affecting multiple steps in the glucocorticoid signaling cascade, including the affinity for the ligand, the time required for nuclear translocation, and the interaction with the glucocorticoid-interacting protein-1 coactivator.

11528396|t|Mutations in the gene encoding immunoglobulin mu-binding protein 2 cause spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1.
11528396|a|Classic spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by mutations in the telomeric copy of SMN1. Its product is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoplasmic assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, pre-mRNA processing and activation of transcription. Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress (SMARD) is clinically and genetically distinct from SMA. Here we demonstrate that SMARD type 1 (SMARD1) results from mutations in the gene encoding immunoglobulin micro-binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2; on chromosome 11q13.2-q13.4). In six SMARD1 families, we detected three recessive missense mutations (exons 5, 11 and 12), two nonsense mutations (exons 2 and 5), one frameshift deletion (exon 5) and one splice donor-site mutation (intron 13). Mutations in mouse Ighmbp2 (ref. 14) have been shown to be responsible for spinal muscular atrophy in the neuromuscular degeneration (nmd) mouse, whose phenotype resembles the SMARD1 phenotype. Like the SMN1 product, IGHMBP2 colocalizes with the RNA-processing machinery in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Our results show that IGHMBP2 is the second gene found to be defective in spinal muscular atrophy, and indicate that IGHMBP2 and SMN share common functions important for motor neuron maintenance and integrity in mammals.

18830229|t|Missense mutations to the TSC1 gene cause tuberous sclerosis complex.
18830229|a|Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by the development of hamartomas in a variety of organs and tissues. The disease is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9q34 or the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16p13.3. The TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, TSC1 and TSC2, interact to form a protein complex that inhibits signal transduction to the downstream effectors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Here we investigate the effects of putative TSC1 missense mutations identified in individuals with signs and/or symptoms of TSC on TSC1-TSC2 complex formation and mTOR signalling. We show that specific amino-acid substitutions close to the N-terminal of TSC1 reduce steady-state levels of TSC1, resulting in the activation of mTOR signalling and leading to the symptoms of TSC.

29187746|t|Genome-wide haplotype-based association analysis of major depressive disorder in Generation Scotland and UK Biobank.
29187746|a|Genome-wide association studies using genotype data have had limited success in the identification of variants associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Haplotype data provide an alternative method for detecting associations between variants in weak linkage disequilibrium with genotyped variants and a given trait of interest. A genome-wide haplotype association study for MDD was undertaken utilising a family-based population cohort, Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (n = 18,773), as a discovery cohort with UK Biobank used as a population-based replication cohort (n = 25,035). Fine mapping of haplotype boundaries was used to account for overlapping haplotypes potentially tagging the same causal variant. Within the discovery cohort, two haplotypes exceeded genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10

17668386|t|Permanent neonatal diabetes caused by dominant, recessive, or compound heterozygous SUR1 mutations with opposite functional effects.
17668386|a|Heterozygous activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene encoding the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunit of the pancreatic beta cell K(ATP) channel are the most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM). Patients with PNDM due to a heterozygous activating mutation in the ABCC8 gene encoding the SUR1 regulatory subunit of the K(ATP) channel have recently been reported. We studied a cohort of 59 patients with permanent diabetes who received a diagnosis before 6 mo of age and who did not have a KCNJ11 mutation. ABCC8 gene mutations were identified in 16 of 59 patients and included 8 patients with heterozygous de novo mutations. A recessive mode of inheritance was observed in eight patients with homozygous, mosaic, or compound heterozygous mutations. Functional studies of selected mutations showed a reduced response to ATP consistent with an activating mutation that results in reduced insulin secretion. A novel mutational mechanism was observed in which a heterozygous activating mutation resulted in PNDM only when a second, loss-of-function mutation was also present.

18518985|t|A novel WFS1 mutation in a family with dominant low frequency sensorineural hearing loss with normal VEMP and EcochG findings.
18518985|a|Low frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHL) is an uncommon clinical finding. Mutations within three different identified genes (DIAPH1, MYO7A, and WFS1) are known to cause LFSNHL. The majority of hereditary LFSNHL is associated with heterozygous mutations in the WFS1 gene (wolframin protein). The goal of this study was to use genetic analysis to determine if a small American family's hereditary LFSNHL is linked to a mutation in the WFS1 gene and to use VEMP and EcochG testing to further characterize the family's audiovestibular phenotype.The clinical phenotype of the American family was characterized by audiologic testing, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP), and electrocochleography (EcochG) evaluation. Genetic characterization was performed by microsatellite analysis and direct sequencing of WFS1 for mutation detection.Sequence analysis of the WFS1 gene revealed a novel heterozygous mutation at c.2054G>C predicting a p.R685P amino acid substitution in wolframin. The c.2054G>C mutation segregates faithfully with hearing loss in the family and is absent in 230 control chromosomes. The p.R685 residue is located within the hydrophilic C-terminus of wolframin and is conserved across species. The VEMP and EcochG findings were normal in individuals segregating the WFS1 c.2054G>C mutation.We discovered a novel heterozygous missense mutation in exon 8 of WFS1 predicting a p.R685P amino acid substitution that is likely to underlie the LFSNHL phenotype in the American family. For the first time, we describe VEMP and EcochG findings for individuals segregating a heterozygous WFS1 mutation.

20554659|t|Genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (ALDH7A1 deficiency).
20554659|a|Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy was recently shown to be due to mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene, which encodes antiquitin, an enzyme that catalyses the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent dehydrogenation of l-alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde/L-Delta1-piperideine 6-carboxylate. However, whilst this is a highly treatable disorder, there is general uncertainty about when to consider this diagnosis and how to test for it. This study aimed to evaluate the use of measurement of urine L-alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde/creatinine ratio and mutation analysis of ALDH7A1 (antiquitin) in investigation of patients with suspected or clinically proven pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy and to characterize further the phenotypic spectrum of antiquitin deficiency. Urinary L-alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde concentration was determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. When this was above the normal range, DNA sequencing of the ALDH7A1 gene was performed. Clinicians were asked to complete questionnaires on clinical, biochemical, magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography features of patients. The clinical spectrum of antiquitin deficiency extended from ventriculomegaly detected on foetal ultrasound, through abnormal foetal movements and a multisystem neonatal disorder, to the onset of seizures and autistic features after the first year of life. Our relatively large series suggested that clinical diagnosis of pyridoxine dependent epilepsy can be challenging because: (i) there may be some response to antiepileptic drugs; (ii) in infants with multisystem pathology, the response to pyridoxine may not be instant and obvious; and (iii) structural brain abnormalities may co-exist and be considered sufficient cause of epilepsy, whereas the fits may be a consequence of antiquitin deficiency and are then responsive to pyridoxine. These findings support the use of biochemical and DNA tests for antiquitin deficiency and a clinical trial of pyridoxine in infants and children with epilepsy across a broad range of clinical scenarios.

16141009|t|ASPM mutations identified in patients with primary microcephaly and seizures.
16141009|a|Human autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a heterogeneous disorder with at least six genetic loci (MCPH1-6), with MCPH5, caused by ASPM mutation, being the most common. Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy in microcephaly patients, microcephaly with frequent seizures has been excluded from the ascertainment of MCPH. Here, we report a pedigree with multiple affected individuals with microcephaly and seizures.To identify the gene responsible for microcephaly and seizures in this pedigree.Clinical assessments of three patients and brain MRIs of two patients were obtained. Genome-wide linkage screen with 10 k SNP microarray, fine mapping with microsatellite markers, and mutational analysis of the genomic DNA were performed on the pedigree.We found that the family was linked to the MCPH5 locus on chromosome 1q31.2-q32.1. We screened ASPM and identified a previously unreported nonsense mutation that introduced a premature stop codon in exon 18 of the ASPM gene.We thus expand the clinical spectrum of ASPM mutations by showing that they can occur in patients with seizures and that the history of seizures alone should not necessarily preclude the diagnosis of primary microcephaly.

24632578|t|Combined effects of genetic variants of the PTEN, AKT1, MDM2 and p53 genes on the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
24632578|a|Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) and p53 play important roles in the development of cancer. We examined whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PTEN, AKT1, MDM2 and p53 genes were related to the risk and severity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the Chinese population. Seven SNPs [p53 rs1042522, PTEN rs11202592, AKT1 SNP1-5 (rs3803300, rs1130214, rs3730358, rs1130233 and rs2494732)] were genotyped in 593 NPC cases and 480 controls by PCR direct sequencing or PCR-RFLP analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). None of the polymorphisms alone was associated with the risk or severity of NPC. However, haplotype analyses indicated that a two-SNP core haplotype (SNP4-5, AA) in AKT1 was associated with a significantly increased susceptibility to NPC risk (adjusted OR  =  3.87, 95% CI  =  1.96-7.65; P<0.001). Furthermore, there was a significantly increased risk of NPC associated with the combined risk genotypes (i.e., p53 rs1042522 Arg/Pro + Pro/Pro, MDM2 rs2279244 G/T + G/G, PTEN rs11202592 C/C, AKT1 rs1130233 A/A). Compared with the low-risk group (0-2 combined risk genotypes), the high-risk group (3-4 combined risk genotypes) was associated with a significantly increased susceptibility to NPC risk (adjusted OR  =  1.67, 95% CI  =  1.12-2.50; P = 0.012). Our results suggest that genetic variants in the PTEN, AKT1, MDM2 and p53 tumor suppressor-oncoprotein network may play roles in mediating the susceptibility to NPC in Chinese populations.

9554454|t|Six new Gaucher disease mutations.
9554454|a|Six previously undescribed mutations were identified in 6 unrelated Gaucher disease patients: 437C-->T (107Ser-->Leu), 593C-->T (159Pro-->Leu), 604C-->T (163Arg-->Stop), 1138G-->A (341Ala-->Thr), 1214G-->A (366Ser-->Asn), 1294T-->A (393Trp-->Arg). Five patients were compound heterozygotes and 1 patient was a 593T/593T homozygote. Four patients had type I Gaucher disease with mild clinical phenotypes. Two other patients manifested central nervous system involvement (type II and type III).

25501212|t|Association of MSX1 and TGF-β1 genetic polymorphisms with hypodontia: meta-analysis.
25501212|a|We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 4 case-control studies to explore the association between polymorphisms of Msh homeobox 1 (MSX1) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) genes and hypodontia. A total of 643 tooth agenesis cases and 733 healthy controls were included in this study. The meta-analysis results showed that the T allele and T carrier (CT + TT) of rs1095 in the MSX1 gene were positively associated with hypodontia susceptibility. However, the T allele and T carrier (TC + CC) of rs12532 and rs8670 showed no association with cancer susceptibility. In addition, there were no strong associations between the T allele and T carrier (CT + TT) of C509T and the A allele and A carrier (AG + AA) of G800A in the TGF-β1 gene polymorphisms between patients with tooth agenesis and healthy subjects. In conclusion, these meta-analysis results demonstrated that polymorphisms in the rs1095 region of the MSX1 gene may influence the transcriptional activity of this gene and are associated with hypodontia in humans. However, the association between the TGF-β1 gene and sporadic tooth agenesis is not well understood, and further studies are required to explore the correlation between the TGF-β1 gene and hypodontia. 

9853249|t|Functional characterization of renal chloride channel, CLCN5, mutations associated with Dent'sJapan disease.
9853249|a|The annual urinary screening of Japanese children above three years of age has identified a progressive renal tubular disorder characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis, and this represents a variant of Dent's disease. Hitherto, 12 mutations of the X-linked renal specific chloride channel, CLCN5, have been reported in the Dent'sJapan variant. To further identify such CLCN5 mutations and to define the structure-function relationships of this channel, we have investigated five unrelated, non-consanguinous Japanese families with this disorder.Leukocyte DNA from probands was used with CLCN5 primers for PCR amplification of the coding region, and the DNA sequences of the products determined. Functional studies were performed by expressing the mutants in Xenopus oocytes.Five CLCN5 mutations consisting of two nonsense (R648X and R704X), two missense (S270R and L278F) and one acceptor splice site mutation (ag-->cg) in intron 4 were identified. The missense and splice site mutations represent novel abnormalities. Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes of wild-type and the missense mutants demonstrated that the mutations, which were translated, either abolished or markedly reduced chloride conductance.These results expand the spectrum of CLCN5 mutations associated with this renal disorder and provide insight into possible structure-function relationships. For example, both the missense mutations are located within a short putative loop between two transmembrane domains, and our results suggest that this region may have an important functional role in the regulation of channel activity.

15519027|t|Myosin binding protein C mutations and compound heterozygosity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
15519027|a|We sought to determine the frequency and phenotype of mutations in myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) in a large outpatient cohort of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) seen at our tertiary referral center.Mutations in MYBPC3 are one of the most frequent genetic causes of HCM and have been associated with variable onset of disease and prognosis. However, the frequency of mutations and associated clinical presentation have not been established in a large, unrelated cohort of patients.Using deoxyribonucleic acid from 389 unrelated patients with HCM, each protein coding exon of MYBPC3 was analyzed for mutations by polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and direct deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing. Clinical data were extracted from patient records blinded to patient genotype.Of 389 patients with HCM, 71 (18%) had mutations in MYBPC3. In all, 46 mutations were identified, 33 of which were novel (72%). Patients with MYBPC3 mutations did not differ significantly from patients with thick filament-HCM, thin filament-HCM, or genotype-negative HCM with respect to age at diagnosis, degree of hypertrophy, incidence of myectomy, or family history of HCM or sudden death. Patients with multiple mutations (n = 10, 2.6%) had the most severe disease presentation.This study defines the frequency and associated phenotype for MYBPC3 and/or multiple mutations in HCM in the largest cohort to date. In this cohort, unrelated patients with MYBPC3-HCM virtually mimicked the phenotype of those with mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain. Patients with multiple mutations had the most severe phenotype.

25643770|t|Association study of stuttering candidate genes GNPTAB, GNPTG and NAGPA with dyslexia in Chinese population.
25643770|a|Dyslexia is a polygenic speech and language disorder characterized by an unexpected difficulty in reading in children and adults despite normal intelligence and schooling. Increasing evidence reveals that different speech and language disorders could share common genetic factors. As previous study reported association of GNPTAB, GNPTG and NAGPA with stuttering, we investigated these genes with dyslexia through association analysis.The study was carried out in an unrelated Chinese cohort with 502 dyslexic individuals and 522 healthy controls. In all, 21 Tag SNPs covering GNPTAB, GNPTG and NAGPA were subjected to genotyping. Association analysis was performed on all SNPs. Significant association of rs17031962 in GNPTAB and rs882294 in NAGPA with developmental dyslexia was identified after FDR correction for multiple comparisons.Our results revealed that the stuttering risk genes GNPTAB and NAGPA might also associate with developmental dyslexia in the Chinese population.

25148534|t|Genetic variants of CD209 associated with Kawasaki disease susceptibility.
25148534|a|Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis with unknown etiology mainly affecting children in Asian countries. Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN, CD209) in humans was showed to trigger an anti-inflammatory cascade and associated with KD susceptibility. This study was conducted to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms of CD209 and the risk KD.A total of 948 subjects (381 KD and 567 controls) were recruited. Nine tagging SNPs (rs8112310, rs4804800, rs11465421, rs1544766, rs4804801, rs2287886, rs735239, rs735240, rs4804804) were selected for TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. Clinical phenotypes, coronary artery lesions (CAL) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment outcomes were collected for analysis.Significant associations were found between CD209 polymorphisms (rs4804800, rs2287886, rs735240) and the risk of KD. Haplotype analysis for CD209 polymorphisms showed that A/A/G haplotype (P = 0.0002, OR = 1.61) and G/A/G haplotype (P = 0.0365, OR = 1.52) had higher risk of KD as compared with G/G/A haplotype in rs2287886/rs735239/rs735240 pairwise allele analysis. There were no significant association in KD with regards to CAL formation and IVIG treatment responses.CD209 polymorphisms were responsible for the susceptibility of KD, but not CAL formation and IVIG treatment responsiveness.

Clinicians also are advised to take notice of the date this statement was adopted and to consider other medical and scientific information that becomes available after that date. It also would be prudent to consider whether intellectual property interests may restrict the performance of certain tests and other procedures.To promote standardized reporting of actionable information from clinical genomic sequencing, in 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a minimum list of genes to be reported as incidental or secondary findings. The goal was to identify and manage risks for selected highly penetrant genetic disorders through established interventions aimed at preventing or significantly reducing morbidity and mortality. The ACMG subsequently established the Secondary Findings Maintenance Working Group to develop a process for curating and updating the list over time. We describe here the new process for accepting and evaluating nominations for updates to the secondary findings list. We also report outcomes from six nominations received in the initial 15 months after the process was implemented. Applying the new process while upholding the core principles of the original policy statement resulted in the addition of four genes and removal of one gene; one gene did not meet criteria for inclusion. The updated secondary findings minimum list includes 59 medically actionable genes recommended for return in clinical genomic sequencing. We discuss future areas of focus, encourage continued input from the medical community, and call for research on the impact of returning genomic secondary findings.Genet Med 19 2, 249-255.

25423914|t|Interplay between 3'-UTR polymorphisms in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and metabolic syndrome in determining the risk of colorectal cancer in Koreans.
25423914|a|Polymorphisms in angiogenesis-related genes and metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors play important roles in cancer development. Moreover, recent studies have reported associations between a number of 3'-UTR polymorphisms and a variety of cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of three VEGF 3'-UTR polymorphisms (1451C > T [rs3025040], 1612G > A [rs10434], and 1725G > A [rs3025053]) and MetS with colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility in Koreans.A total of 850 participants (450 CRC patients and 400 controls) were enrolled in the study. The genotyping of VEGF polymorphisms was performed by TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Cancer risks of genetic variations and gene-environment interactions were assessed by adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of multivariate logistic regression analyses.VEGF 1451C > T was significantly associated with rectal cancer risk (Dominant model; AOR =1.58; 95% CI = 1.09 - 2.28; p = 0.015) whereas VEGF 1725G > A correlated with MetS risk (Dominant model; AOR =1.61; 95% CI =1.06 - 2.46; p = 0.026). Of the gene-environment combined effects, the interaction of VEGF 1451C > T and MetS contributed to increased rectal cancer risk (AOR = 3.15; 95% CI = 1.74 - 5.70; p < .001) whereas the combination of VEGF 1725G > A and MetS was involved with elevated colon cancer risk (AOR = 2.68; 95% CI = 1.30 - 1.55; p =0.008).Our results implicate that VEGF 1451C > T and 1725G > A may predispose to CRC susceptibility and the genetic contributions may be varied with the presence of MetS.

22871920|t|Genetics and molecular basis of human peroxisome biogenesis disorders.
22871920|a|Human peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders comprised of two clinically distinct subtypes: the Zellweger syndrome spectrum (ZSS) disorders and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) type 1. PBDs are caused by defects in any of at least 14 different PEX genes, which encode proteins involved in peroxisome assembly and proliferation. Thirteen of these genes are associated with ZSS disorders. The genetic heterogeneity among PBDs and the inability to predict from the biochemical and clinical phenotype of a patient with ZSS which of the currently known 13 PEX genes is defective, has fostered the development of different strategies to identify the causative gene defects. These include PEX cDNA transfection complementation assays followed by sequencing of the thus identified PEX genes, and a PEX gene screen in which the most frequently mutated exons of the different PEX genes are analyzed. The benefits of DNA testing for PBDs include carrier testing of relatives, early prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis in families with a recurrence risk for ZSS disorders, and insight in genotype-phenotype correlations, which may eventually assist to improve patient management. In this review we describe the current status of genetic analysis and the molecular basis of PBDs.

27592234|t|Variants in LTA, TNF, IL1B and IL10 genes associated with the clinical course of sepsis.
27592234|a|The aim of this study was to explore the association between some SNPs of the TNF, LTA, IL1B and IL10 genes with cytokine concentrations and clinical course in Colombian septic patients. We conducted a cross-sectional study to genotype 415 septic patients and 205 patients without sepsis for the SNPs -308(G/A) rs1800629 of TNF; +252 (G/A) rs909253 of LTA; -511(A/G) rs16944 and +3953(C/T) rs1143634 of IL1B; and -1082(A/G) rs1800896, -819(C/T) rs1800871 and -592(C/A) rs1800872 of IL10. The association of theses SNPs with the following parameters was evaluated: (1) the presence of sepsis; (2) severity and clinical outcomes; (3) APACHE II and SOFA scores; and (4) procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor, lymphotoxin alpha, interleukin 1 beta and interleukin 10 plasma concentrations. We found an association between the SNP LTA +252 with the development of sepsis [OR 1.29 (1.00-1.68)]; the SNP IL10 -1082 with sepsis severity [OR 0.53 (0.29-0.97)]; the TNF -308 with mortality [OR 0.33 (0.12-0.95)]; and the IL10 -592 and IL10 -1082 with admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) [OR 3.36 (1.57-7.18)] and [OR 0.18 (0.04-0.86)], respectively. None of the SNPs were associated with cytokine levels, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein serum concentrations, nor with APACHE II and SOFA scores. Our results suggest that these genetic variants play an important role in the development of sepsis and its clinical course.

23219996|t|Novel homozygous mutations in the genes ARL6 and BBS10 underlying Bardet-Biedl syndrome.
23219996|a|Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from structural and functional defects in numerous organs. Frequent manifestations reported in the syndrome include obesity, renal dysplasia, cognitive impairment, postaxial polydactyly, pigmentary retinal degeneration and hypogonadism. To date, 17 genes causing BBS have been identified. Two of these BBS1 and BBS10 are the most frequently mutated genes. The present report describes two consanguineous families (A, B) with clinical manifestations of BBS. Linkage in the family A was established to ARL6 on chromosome 3q11.2, while family B showed linkage to BBS10 on chromosome 12q21.2. Sequence analysis revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation (c.281T>C, p.Ile94Thr) in the gene ARL6 in family A and a nonsense mutation (c.1075C>T, p.Gln359*) in the gene BBS10 in family B. Mutations identified in the present study extend the body of evidence implicating the genes ARL6 and BBS10 in causing Bardet-Biedl syndrome.

9215689|t|Germline mutations of the MEN1 gene in familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and related states.
9215689|a|Familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (FMEN1) is an autosomal dominant trait characterized by tumors of the parathyroids, gastro-intestinal endocrine tissue, anterior pituitary and other tissues. We recently cloned the MEN1 gene and confirmed its identity by finding mutations in FMEN1. We have now extended our mutation analysis to 34 more unrelated FMEN1 probands and to two related states, sporadic MEN1 and familial hyperparathyroidism. There was a high prevalence of heterozygous germline MEN1 mutations in sporadic MEN1 (8/11 cases) and in FMEN1 (47/50 probands). One case of sporadic MEN1 was proven to be a new MEN1 mutation. Eight different mutations were observed more than once in FMEN1. Forty different mutations (32 FMEN1 and eight sporadic MEN1) were distributed across the MEN1 gene. Most predicted loss of function of the encoded menin protein, supporting the prediction that MEN1 is a tumor suppressor gene. No MEN1 germline mutation was found in five probands with familial hyperparathyroidism, suggesting that familial hyperparathyroidism often is caused by mutation in another gene or gene(s).

31451708|t|Mapping eGFR loci to the renal transcriptome and phenome in the VA Million Veteran Program.
31451708|a|Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), contributes to global morbidity and mortality. Here we conduct a transethnic Genome-Wide Association Study of eGFR in 280,722 participants of the Million Veteran Program (MVP), with replication in 765,289 participants from the Chronic Kidney Disease Genetics (CKDGen) Consortium. We identify 82 previously unreported variants, confirm 54 loci, and report interesting findings including association of the sickle cell allele of betaglobin among non-Hispanic blacks. Our transcriptome-wide association study of kidney function in healthy kidney tissue identifies 36 previously unreported and nine known genes, and maps gene expression to renal cell types. In a Phenome-Wide Association Study in 192,868 MVP participants using a weighted genetic score we detect associations with CKD stages and complications and kidney stones. This investigation reinterprets the genetic architecture of kidney function to identify the gene, tissue, and anatomical context of renal homeostasis and the clinical consequences of dysregulation.

10332035|t|Correlations of genotype and phenotype in hypophosphatasia.
10332035|a|Hypophosphatasia, a rare inherited disorder characterized by defective bone mineralization, is highly variable in its clinical expression. The disease is due to various mutations in the tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase ( TNSALP ) gene. We report here the use of clinical data, site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modelling to propose a classification of 32 TNSALP gene mutations found in 23 European patients, 17 affected with lethal hypophosphatasia and six with non-lethal hypophosphatasia. Transfection studies of the missense mutations found in non-lethal hypophosphatasia showed that six of them allowed significant residual in vitro enzymatic activity, suggesting that these mutations corresponded to moderate alleles. Each of the six patients with non-lethal hypophosphatasia carried at least one of these alleles. The three-dimensional model study showed that moderate mutations were not found in the active site, and that most of the severe missense mutations were localized in crucial domains such as the active site, the vicinity of the active site and homodimer interface. Some mutations appeared to be organized in clusters on the surface of the molecule that may represent possible candidates for regions interacting with the C-terminal end involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment or with other dimers to form tetramers. Finally, our results show a good correlation between clinical forms of the disease, mutagenesis experiments and the three-dimensional structure study, and allowed us to clearly distinguish moderate alleles from severe alleles. They also confirm that the extremely high phenotypic heterogeneity observed in patients with hypophosphatasia was due mainly to variable residual enzymatic activities allowed by missense mutations found in the human TNSALP gene.

11606101|t|Germline BRCA1-2 mutations in non-Ashkenazi families with double primary breast and ovarian cancer.
11606101|a|Ashkenazi women with double primary breast and ovarian cancer have a high prevalence (57%) of germline Jewish founder mutations in the BRCA1 (185delAG, 5382insC) and BRCA2 (6174delT) genes. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and type of BRCA1-2 mutations in non-Ashkenazi families with at least one member having double primary breast and ovarian cancer.Women at increased risk for cancer based upon their family history were enrolled at the University of Texas Southwestern Familial Cancer Registry between 1992 and 2000. Blood samples from patients desiring genetic testing were sent for complete DNA sequencing of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Families with a member having both breast and ovarian cancer were identified and clinical data were obtained.Sixty-two (7%) of 900 enrolled families were non-Ashkenazi and had at least one member with double primary breast and ovarian cancer. Twenty-one families had members who underwent genetic testing; 41 did not. Thirteen (62%) families had a germline BRCA1 (n = 11) or BRCA2 (n = 2) mutation; only one Jewish founder mutation (185delAG) was detected. Eight (38%) families tested negative. Six (86%) of seven women undergoing genetic testing who themselves had double primary breast and ovarian cancer were BRCA1-2 mutation carriers.Germline BRCA1-2 mutations are common in non-Ashkenazi families with a member having double primary breast and ovarian cancer. These mutations occurred throughout both genes, emphasizing the need for comprehensive sequencing. One family had the BRCA2 6985delCT mutation, which lies beyond the "ovarian cancer cluster" region.

9580132|t|Identification of a novel nonsense mutation and a missense substitution in the vasopressin-neurophysin II gene in two Spanish kindreds with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus.
9580132|a|Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by deficiency in the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) encoded by the AVP-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene on chromosome 20p13. In this study, we analyzed two families with FNDI using direct automated fluorescent, solid phase, single-stranded DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified AVP-NPII DNA. In one of the families, affected individuals presented a novel nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the gene, consisting in a G to T transition at nucleotide 2101, which produces a stop signal in codon 82 (Glu) of NPII. The premature termination eliminates part of the C-terminal domain of NPII, including a cysteine residue in position 85, which could be involved in the correct folding of the prohormone. In the second family, a G279A substitution at position -1 of the signal peptide was observed in all affected individuals. This missense mutation, which replaces Ala with Thr, is frequent among FNDI patients and is thought to reduce the efficiency of cleavage by signal peptidases.

23788249|t|ACMG recommendations for reporting of incidental findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing.
23788249|a|In clinical exome and genome sequencing, there is a potential for the recognition and reporting of incidental or secondary findings unrelated to the indication for ordering the sequencing but of medical value for patient care. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recently published a policy statement on clinical sequencing that emphasized the importance of alerting the patient to the possibility of such results in pretest patient discussions, clinical testing, and reporting of results. The ACMG appointed a Working Group on Incidental Findings in Clinical Exome and Genome Sequencing to make recommendations about responsible management of incidental findings when patients undergo exome or genome sequencing. This Working Group conducted a year-long consensus process, including an open forum at the 2012 Annual Meeting and review by outside experts, and produced recommendations that have been approved by the ACMG Board. Specific and detailed recommendations, and the background and rationale for these recommendations, are described herein. The ACMG recommends that laboratories performing clinical sequencing seek and report mutations of the specified classes or types in the genes listed here. This evaluation and reporting should be performed for all clinical germline (constitutional) exome and genome sequencing, including the "normal" of tumor-normal subtractive analyses in all subjects, irrespective of age but excluding fetal samples. We recognize that there are insufficient data on penetrance and clinical utility to fully support these recommendations, and we encourage the creation of an ongoing process for updating these recommendations at least annually as further data are collected.

26061994|t|An intron SNP rs807185 in ATG4A decreases the risk of lung cancer in a southwest Chinese population.
26061994|a|Autophagy acts as a double-edged sword in cancer. Over the years, there has been growing evidence of the involvement of autophagy-related genes (ATGs) in the etiology and progression of cancer. Importantly, lung cancer is one of the most common cancers and represents the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in developing countries. The genomic variant has emerged as an important factor in the risk of lung cancer. Here, we hypothesize that the intron single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of rs807185 in ATG4A is associated with the risk of lung cancer. In this case-control study, we genotyped the SNP rs807185 with PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Our data suggest that the variant A allele frequency of rs807185 in controls is higher than that in cases (37.7 vs. 24.9%, P=0.006). The adjusted odds ratio is 1.989 (95% confidence interval 1.223-3.236). Compared with the wild T allele, the variant A allele of rs807185 in ATG4A is associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer (adjusted odds ratio=0.605, 95% confidence interval 0.456-0.803, P<0.001). Furthermore, stratified analysis in a recessive model suggests that the homozygous variant genotype (AA) of rs807185 could decrease the risk of lung cancer in smoking or nonsmoking groups. In conclusion, the variant of intron SNP rs807185 in ATG4A is associated significantly with a decreased risk of lung cancer in a southwest Chinese population. The results show that the variant rs807185 of ATG4A might be a protective factor for lung cancer.

23396983|t|Genetic complexity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy revealed by high-throughput sequencing.
23396983|a|Clinical interpretation of the large number of rare variants identified by high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies is challenging. The aim of this study was to explore the clinical implications of a HTS strategy for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using a targeted HTS methodology and workflow developed for patients with a range of inherited cardiovascular diseases. By comparing the sequencing results with published findings and with sequence data from a large-scale exome sequencing screen of UK individuals, we sought to quantify the strength of the evidence supporting causality for detected candidate variants.223 unrelated patients with HCM (46±15 years at diagnosis, 74% males) were studied. In order to analyse coding, intronic and regulatory regions of 41 cardiovascular genes, we used solution-based sequence capture followed by massive parallel resequencing on Illumina GAIIx. Average read-depth in the 2.1 Mb target region was 120. Rare (frequency<0.5%) non-synonymous, loss-of-function and splice-site variants were defined as candidates. Excluding titin, we identified 152 distinct candidate variants in sarcomeric or associated genes (89 novel) in 143 patients (64%). Four sarcomeric genes (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNI3, TNNT2) showed an excess of rare single non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in cases compared to controls. The estimated probability that a nsSNP in these genes is pathogenic varied between 57% and near certainty depending on the location. We detected an additional 94 candidate variants (73 novel) in desmosomal, and ion-channel genes in 96 patients (43%).This study provides the first large-scale quantitative analysis of the prevalence of sarcomere protein gene variants in patients with HCM using HTS technology. Inclusion of other genes implicated in inherited cardiac disease identifies a large number of non-synonymous rare variants of unknown clinical significance.

12588888|t|Mutation causing severe myasthenia reveals functional asymmetry of AChR signature cystine loops in agonist binding and gating.
12588888|a|We describe a highly disabling congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) associated with rapidly decaying, low-amplitude synaptic currents, and trace its cause to a valine to leucine mutation in the signature cystine loop (cys-loop) of the AChR alpha subunit. The recently solved crystal structure of an ACh-binding protein places the cys-loop at the junction between the extracellular ligand-binding and transmembrane domains where it may couple agonist binding to channel gating. We therefore analyzed the kinetics of ACh-induced single-channel currents to identify elementary steps in the receptor activation mechanism altered by the alphaV132L mutation. The analysis reveals that alphaV132L markedly impairs ACh binding to receptors in the resting closed state, decreasing binding affinity for the second binding step 30-fold, but attenuates gating efficiency only about twofold. By contrast, mutation of the equivalent valine residue in the delta subunit impairs channel gating approximately fourfold with little effect on ACh binding, while corresponding mutations in the beta and epsilon subunits are without effect. The unique functional contribution of the alpha subunit cys-loop likely owes to its direct connection via a beta strand to alphaW149 at the center of the ligand-binding domain. The overall findings reveal functional asymmetry between cys-loops of the different AChR subunits in contributing to ACh binding and channel gating.

24166829|t|Mutations and polymorphisms in the human argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) gene.
24166829|a|Argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASLD) is caused by a defect of the urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) encoded by the ASL gene. Patients often present early after birth with hyperammonemia but can also manifest outside the neonatal period mainly triggered by excessive protein catabolism. Clinical courses comprise asymptomatic individuals who only excrete the biochemical marker, argininosuccinic acid, in urine, and patients who succumb to their first hyperammonemic decompensation. Some patients without any hyperammonemia develop severe neurological disease. Here, we are providing an update on the molecular basis of ASLD by collecting all published (n = 67) as well as novel mutations (n = 67) of the ASL gene. We compile data on all 160 different genotypes ever identified in 223 ASLD patients, including clinical courses whenever available. Finally, we are presenting structural considerations focusing on the relevance of mutations for ASL homotetramer formation. ASLD can be considered as a panethnic disease with only single founder mutations identified in the Finnish (c.299T>C, p.Ile100Thr) and Arab (c.1060C>T, p.Gln354*) population. Most mutations are private with only few genotypes recurring in unrelated patients. The majority of mutations are missense changes including some with more frequent occurrence such as p.Arg12Gln, p.Ile100Thr, p.Val178Met, p.Arg186Trp, p.Glu189Gly, p.Gln286Arg, and p.Arg385Cys. 

22504420|t|Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies 56 bone mineral density loci and reveals 14 loci associated with risk of fracture.
22504420|a|Bone mineral density (BMD) is the most widely used predictor of fracture risk. We performed the largest meta-analysis to date on lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD, including 17 genome-wide association studies and 32,961 individuals of European and east Asian ancestry. We tested the top BMD-associated markers for replication in 50,933 independent subjects and for association with risk of low-trauma fracture in 31,016 individuals with a history of fracture (cases) and 102,444 controls. We identified 56 loci (32 new) associated with BMD at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Several of these factors cluster within the RANK-RANKL-OPG, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, endochondral ossification and Wnt signaling pathways. However, we also discovered loci that were localized to genes not known to have a role in bone biology. Fourteen BMD-associated loci were also associated with fracture risk (P < 5 × 10(-4), Bonferroni corrected), of which six reached P < 5 × 10(-8), including at 18p11.21 (FAM210A), 7q21.3 (SLC25A13), 11q13.2 (LRP5), 4q22.1 (MEPE), 2p16.2 (SPTBN1) and 10q21.1 (DKK1). These findings shed light on the genetic architecture and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying BMD variation and fracture susceptibility.

22772377|t|Exon 47 skipping of fibrillin-1 leads preferentially to cardiovascular defects in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.
22772377|a|Excessive activation of the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway and disorganized cellular skeleton caused by genetic mutations are known to be responsible for the inherited thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD), a life-threatening vascular disease. To investigate the genotype-phenotype correlation, we screened genetic mutations of fibrillin-1 (FBN1), transforming growth factor-β receptor-1 (TGFBR1) and transforming growth factor-β receptor-2 (TGFBR2) for TAAD in 7 affected families and 22 sporadic patients. Of 19 potential mutations identified in FBN1, 11 appeared novel while the others were recurrent. Two mutations were detected in TGFBR2. Eight patients carried no mutation in either of these genes. Characterization of FBN1 c.5917+6T>C in transfected HEK293 cells demonstrated that it caused skipping of exon 47, leading to the loss of the 33th calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like domain associated with Marfan syndrome. Compared with exon 46, skipping of 47 did not cause patients ectopia lentis in all carriers. To correlate genotypes with phenotypes in different human ancestries, we reviewed the published mutational studies on FBN1 and found that the probability of cardiovascular defects were significantly increased in Chinese patients with premature termination codon or splicing mutations than those with missense mutations (91.7 % vs 54.2 %, P = 0.0307) or with noncysteine-involved point mutations than those with cysteine-involved mutations (88.9 % vs 33.3 %, P = 0.0131). Thus, we conclude that exon 47 skipping of FBN1 leads preferentially to cardiovascular defects and human ancestries influence genotype-phenotype correlation in TAAD.

15776427|t|Lysinuric protein intolerance: identification and functional analysis of mutations of the SLC7A7 gene.
15776427|a|Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is an inherited hyperdibasic aminoaciduria caused by defective cationic amino acid (CAA) transport at the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells in the intestine and kidney. LPI is relatively common in Finland and a few clusters of patients are known in Italy and Japan. The SLC7A7 gene, mutated in LPI patients, encodes the y+LAT-1 protein which is the light subunit of a heterodimeric CAA transporter. We performed the mutation analysis in seven probands from five unrelated LPI families and identified five novel SLC7A7 mutations (p.M50K, p.T188I, p.R333M, p.Y457X, and c.499+?_629-?). By expression studies in X. laevis oocytes or patient's renal tubular cells, the functional analysis of altogether eight SLC7A7 mutations is here reported. Noteworthy, the p.R333M mutation, caused by a G to T transversion of the last nucleotide at 3' end of exon 7, disrupts a functional splicing motif generating misspliced transcripts. Three of the novel mutations were found in patients originating from Greece and Pakistan thus increasing the list of ethnic backgrounds where LPI mutant alleles are present. This reinforces the view that the rarity of LPI outside Finland might be ascribed to misdiagnosis of this disease.

19896331|t|No major clinical impact of Val66Met BDNF gene polymorphism on temporal lobe epilepsy.
19896331|a|To report the frequencies of Val66Met polymorphism in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) compared to normal controls. We also investigated whether Val66Met promoted differences in major clinical variables of TLE.A case-control study comparing the frequencies of Val66Met polymorphism in 101 Caucasian TLE patients and in 104 Caucasian normal matching controls. In the second step, we evaluated the patient group in terms of the major clinical and electrographic variables related to the epileptogenic process.The frequency of Val66Met polymorphism did not differ between epileptic patients and normal controls. Moreover, the Val66Met polymorphisms did not influence age of epilepsy onset, duration of epilepsy, control of seizures, or extension of the irritative zone. Also, the groups did not differ in terms of family history of epilepsy and presence of aura.In spite of abundant evidence that Val66Met BDNF polymorphism has an impact on several different neurological or psychiatric disorders, we conclude that a major clinical impact of Val66Met polymorphism as a disease modifier in temporal lobe epilepsy is probably unlikely.

27903959|t|Genome-wide haplotype association study identify the FGFR2 gene as a risk gene for acute myeloid leukemia.
27903959|a|Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, and generally considered to be caused by environment and genetic factors. In this study, we combined a genome-wide haplotype association study (GWHAS) and gene prioritization strategy to mine AML-related genetic affect factors and understand its pathogenesis. A total of 175 AML patients were downloaded from the public GEO database (GSE32462) and 218 matched Caucasian controls were from the HapMap Project. We first identified the linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks and performed a GWHAS to scan AML-related haplotypes. Then we mapped these haplotypes to the corresponding genes as candidate. And finally, we prioritized all the AML candidate genes based on the similarity with 38 known AML susceptibility genes. The results showed that 1754 haplotypes were significant associated with AML (P<1E-5) and mapped to 591 candidate genes. After prioritizing all 591 AML candidate genes, we obtained four genes ranking at the front as AML risk genes: RUNX1, JAK1, PDGFRA, and FGFR2. Among them, RUNX1, JAK1 and PDGFRA had been confirmed as AML risk genes. In particular, we found that the gene FGFR2 was a novel AML susceptibility gene with a haplotype TT (rs7090018 and rs2912759) showed significant association with AML (P-value = 7.07E-06). In a word, our findings might provide a new perspective to understand the pathogenesis of AML.

26540169|t|Mosaic and Intronic Mutations in TSC1/TSC2 Explain the Majority of TSC Patients with No Mutation Identified by Conventional Testing.
26540169|a|Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor suppressor gene syndrome due to germline mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. 10-15% of TSC individuals have no mutation identified (NMI) after thorough conventional molecular diagnostic assessment. 53 TSC subjects who were NMI were studied using next generation sequencing to search for mutations in these genes. Blood/saliva DNA including parental samples were available from all subjects, and skin tumor biopsy DNA was available from six subjects. We identified mutations in 45 of 53 subjects (85%). Mosaicism was observed in the majority (26 of 45, 58%), and intronic mutations were also unusually common, seen in 18 of 45 subjects (40%). Seventeen (38%) mutations were seen at an allele frequency < 5%, five at an allele frequency < 1%, and two were identified in skin tumor biopsies only, and were not seen at appreciable frequency in blood or saliva DNA. These findings illuminate the extent of mosaicism in TSC, indicate the importance of full gene coverage and next generation sequencing for mutation detection, show that analysis of TSC-related tumors can increase the mutation detection rate, indicate that it is not likely that a third TSC gene exists, and enable provision of genetic counseling to the substantial population of TSC individuals who are currently NMI. 

26058727|t|Utility of BRAF V600E Immunohistochemistry Expression Pattern as a Surrogate of BRAF Mutation Status in 154 Patients with Advanced Melanoma.
26058727|a|Successful BRAF inhibitor therapy depends on the accurate assessment of the mutation status of the BRAF V600 residue in tissue samples. In melanoma, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis with monoclonal anti-BRAF V600E has emerged as a sensitive and specific surrogate of BRAF V600E mutation, particularly when BRAF V600E protein expression is homogeneous and strong. A subset of melanomas exhibit heterogeneous labeling for BRAF V600E, but our understanding of the significance of heterogeneous BRAF V600E IHC expression is limited. We used next-generation sequencing to compare BRAF V600E IHC staining patterns in 154 melanomas: 79 BRAF(WT) and 75 BRAF (including 53 V600E) mutants. Agreement among dermatopathologists on tumor morphology, IHC expression, and intensity was excellent (ρ = 0.99). A predominantly epithelioid cell phenotype significantly correlated with the BRAF V600E mutation (P = .0085). Tumors demonstrating either heterogeneous or homogeneous IHC expression were significantly associated with the BRAF V600E mutation (P < .0001), as was increased intensity of staining (P < .0001). The positive predictive value was 98% for homogenous IHC expression compared with 70% for heterogeneous labeling. Inclusion of both heterogeneous and homogeneous BRAF V600E IHC expression as a positive test significantly improved IHC test sensitivity from 85% to 98%. However, this reduced BRAF V600E IHC test specificity from 99% to 96%. Cautious evaluation of heterogeneous BRAF V600E IHC expression is warranted and comparison with sequencing results is critical, given its reduced test specificity and positive predictive value for detecting the BRAF V600E mutation. 

27149063|t|RAD51B in Familial Breast Cancer.
27149063|a|Common variation on 14q24.1, close to RAD51B, has been associated with breast cancer: rs999737 and rs2588809 with the risk of female breast cancer and rs1314913 with the risk of male breast cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of RAD51B variants in breast cancer predisposition, particularly in the context of familial breast cancer in Finland. We sequenced the coding region of RAD51B in 168 Finnish breast cancer patients from the Helsinki region for identification of possible recurrent founder mutations. In addition, we studied the known rs999737, rs2588809, and rs1314913 SNPs and RAD51B haplotypes in 44,791 breast cancer cases and 43,583 controls from 40 studies participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) that were genotyped on a custom chip (iCOGS). We identified one putatively pathogenic missense mutation c.541C>T among the Finnish cancer patients and subsequently genotyped the mutation in additional breast cancer cases (n = 5259) and population controls (n = 3586) from Finland and Belarus. No significant association with breast cancer risk was seen in the meta-analysis of the Finnish datasets or in the large BCAC dataset. The association with previously identified risk variants rs999737, rs2588809, and rs1314913 was replicated among all breast cancer cases and also among familial cases in the BCAC dataset. The most significant association was observed for the haplotype carrying the risk-alleles of all the three SNPs both among all cases (odds ratio (OR): 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-1.19, P = 8.88 x 10-16) and among familial cases (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.16-1.32, P = 6.19 x 10-11), compared to the haplotype with the respective protective alleles. Our results suggest that loss-of-function mutations in RAD51B are rare, but common variation at the RAD51B region is significantly associated with familial breast cancer risk.

20385819|t|Genetic variants near TIMP3 and high-density lipoprotein-associated loci influence susceptibility to age-related macular degeneration.
20385819|a|We executed a genome-wide association scan for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in 2,157 cases and 1,150 controls. Our results validate AMD susceptibility loci near CFH (P < 10(-75)), ARMS2 (P < 10(-59)), C2/CFB (P < 10(-20)), C3 (P < 10(-9)), and CFI (P < 10(-6)). We compared our top findings with the Tufts/Massachusetts General Hospital genome-wide association study of advanced AMD (821 cases, 1,709 controls) and genotyped 30 promising markers in additional individuals (up to 7,749 cases and 4,625 controls). With these data, we identified a susceptibility locus near TIMP3 (overall P = 1.1 x 10(-11)), a metalloproteinase involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix and previously implicated in early-onset maculopathy. In addition, our data revealed strong association signals with alleles at two loci (LIPC, P = 1.3 x 10(-7); CETP, P = 7.4 x 10(-7)) that were previously associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels in blood. Consistent with the hypothesis that HDL metabolism is associated with AMD pathogenesis, we also observed association with AMD of HDL-c-associated alleles near LPL (P = 3.0 x 10(-3)) and ABCA1 (P = 5.6 x 10(-4)). Multilocus analysis including all susceptibility loci showed that 329 of 331 individuals (99%) with the highest-risk genotypes were cases, and 85% of these had advanced AMD. Our studies extend the catalog of AMD associated loci, help identify individuals at high risk of disease, and provide clues about underlying cellular pathways that should eventually lead to new therapies.

17873326|t|Two novel genotypes of the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (SLC12A3) gene in patients with Gitelman's syndrome.
17873326|a|Gitelman's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder marked by salt wasting and hypokalaemia resulting from loss-of-function mutations in the SLC12A3 gene that codes for the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter. Gitelman's syndrome is usually distinguished from Bartter's syndrome by the presence of both hypomagnesaemia and hypocalciuria. Although recent advances in molecular genetics may make it possible to both diagnose and differentiate these diseases, the phenotypes sometimes overlap. Here we report two sporadic cases of Gitelman's syndrome and two novel genotypes of SLC12A3. Patient 1 was a compound heterozygote with a known missense mutation, L849H, and a novel mutation, R852H in exon 22. Patient 2 was homozygous for the missense mutation L849H. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient homozygous for 849H. Interestingly, both patients were affected with autoimmune thyroid disease. Patient 1 was affected with Hashimoto's disease, and Patient 2 was affected with Graves' disease. The symptoms of Patient 2 were more serious than those of Patient 1. Although the patients both carried the 849H allele (Patient 1 as a heterozygote and Patient 2 as a homozygous), their clinical symptoms differed. The difference in the clinical features may have been due both to phenotypic differences and the fact that Gitelman's syndrome is a complicated disorder.

21360504|t|Association of a functional IRF7 variant with systemic lupus erythematosus.
21360504|a|A previous genome-wide association study conducted in a population of European ancestry identified rs4963128, a KIAA1542 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 23 kb telomeric to IRF7 (the gene for interferon regulatory factor 7 [IRF-7]), to be strongly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study was undertaken to investigate whether genetic polymorphism within IRF7 is a risk factor for the development of SLE.We genotyped one KIAA1542 SNP (rs4963128) and one IRF7 SNP (rs1131665 [Q412R]) in an Asian population (1,302 cases, 1,479 controls), to assess their association with SLE. Subsequently, rs1131665 was further genotyped in independent panels of Chinese subjects (528 cases, 527 controls), European American subjects (446 cases, 461 controls), and African American subjects (159 cases, 115 controls) by TaqMan genotyping assay, to seek confirmation of association in various ethnic groups. A luciferase reporter assay was used to assess the effect of Q412R polymorphism on the activation of IRF-7.Consistent association of rs1131665 (Q412R) with SLE was identified in Asian, European American, and African American populations (total 2,435 cases and 2,582 controls) (P(meta) = 6.18 × 10(-6) , odds ratio 1.42 [95% confidence interval 1.22-1.65]). Expression of the IRF7 412Q risk allele resulted in a 2-fold increase in interferon-stimulated response element transcriptional activity compared with expression of IRF7 412R (P = 0.0003), suggesting that IRF7 412Q confers elevated IRF-7 activity and may therefore affect a downstream interferon pathway.These findings show that the major allele of a nonsynonymous SNP, rs1131665 (412Q) in IRF7, confers elevated activation of IRF-7 and predisposes to the development of SLE in multiple ethnic groups. This result provides direct genetic evidence that IRF7 may be a risk gene for human SLE.

21119755|t|Profiling β-thalassaemia mutations in India at state and regional levels: implications for genetic education, screening and counselling programmes.
21119755|a|Thalassaemia and sickle cell disease have been recognized by the World Health Organization as important inherited disorders principally impacting on the populations of low income countries. To create a national and regional profile of β-thalassaemia mutations in the population of India, a meta-analysis was conducted on 17 selected studies comprising 8,505 alleles and offering near-national coverage for the disease. At the national level 52 mutations accounted for 97.5% of all β-thalassaemia alleles, with IVSI-5(G>C) the most common disease allele (54.7%). Population stratification was apparent in the mutation profiles at regional level with, for example, the prevalence of IVSI-5(G>C) varying from 44.8% in the North to 71.4% in the East. A number of major mutations, such as Poly A(T>C), were apparently restricted to a particular region of the country, although these findings may in part reflect the variant test protocols adopted by different centres. Given the size and genetic complexity of the Indian population, and with specific mutations for β-thalassaemia known to be strongly associated with individual communities, comprehensive disease registries need to be compiled at state, district and community levels to ensure the efficacy of genetic education, screening and counselling programmes. At the same, time appropriately designed community-based studies are required as a health priority to correct earlier sampling inequities which resulted in the under-representation of many communities, in particular rural and socioeconomically under-privileged groups.The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11568-010-9132-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

27098658|t|Antiphospholipid antibodies in a large population-based cohort: genome-wide associations and effects on monocyte gene expression.
27098658|a|The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterised by venous and/or arterial thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity in women combined with the persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). We aimed to identify genetic factors associated with the presence of aPL in a population based cohort. Furthermore, we wanted to clarify if the presence of aPL affects gene expression in circulating monocytes. Titres of IgG and IgM against cardiolipin, β2glycoprotein 1 (anti-β2GPI), and IgG against domain 1 of β2GPI (anti-domain 1) were determined in approx. 5,000 individuals from the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) a population based cohort of German descent. Genotyping was conducted on Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays. Monocyte gene expression was determined in a subgroup of 1,279 individuals by using the Illumina HT-12 v3 BeadChip. Gene expression data were confirmed in vitro and ex vivo by qRT-PCR. Genome wide analysis revealed significant associations of anti-β2GPI IgG and APOH on chromosome 17, which had been previously identified by candidate gene approaches, and of anti-domain1 and MACROD2 on chromosome 20 which has been listed in a previous GWAS as a suggestive locus associated with the occurrence of anti-β2GPI antibodies. Expression analysis confirmed increased expression of TNFα in monocytes and identified and confirmed neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) as a novel gene induced by aPL. In conclusion, MACROD2 represents a novel genetic locus associated with aPL. Furthermore, we show that aPL induce the expression of NAV3 in monocytes and endothelial cells. This will stimulate further research into the role of these genes in the APS.

26841219|t|Association of RAC1 Gene Polymorphisms with Primary End-Stage Renal Disease in Chinese Renal Recipients.
26841219|a|RAC1 gene could influence susceptibility to renal failure by altering the activity and expression of Rac1, which is a member of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins. In clinical practice, renal transplantation provides the optimal treatment for people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The objective of this present study was to determine whether the RAC1 gene polymorphisms were associated with primary ESRD susceptibility in Chinese renal recipients.Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of RAC1 gene, including rs836488 T>C, rs702482 A>T, rs10951982 G>A, rs702483 A>G, rs6954996 G>A, and rs9374 G>A, were genotyped in 300 renal transplant recipients (cases) and 998 healthy Chinese subjects (controls) by using TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies of the six SNPs were compared between cases and controls. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated in logistic regression models to evaluate the associations of the six SNPs with ESRD risk.The genotype distributions for the six SNPs in controls were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05). Association analysis revealed that three SNPs were significantly associated with ESRD risk. Positive associations with ESRD risk were found for the rs836488, rs702482, and rs702483 in the co-dominant model (minor allele homozygotes versus major allele homozygotes); specifically, the frequencies of the minor allele homozygotes and the minor allele for the three SNPs were higher in the cases than in the controls. In addition, these three SNPs also had associations with increased ESRD risk under the additive model (P < 0.05), and positive associations were also found for the rs836488 in the dominant model (P < 0.05) and for the rs702483 in the recessive model (P < 0.05). All these associations were independent of confounding factors. The other three SNPs (rs10951982, rs6954996, and rs9374), in all comparison models, were not associated with ESRD risk (P > 0.05). In haplotype analysis, carriers with "C-T-G-G-G-G" haplotype had a significantly higher risk of ESRD compared with the most common haplotype "T-A-G-A-G-G" (P = 0.011, OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.09-1.94).This study suggested that polymorphisms of RAC1 gene might influence the susceptibility to ESRD in Chinese Han population. Further studies are necessary to confirm our findings.

17221873|t|GM1 gangliosidosis: molecular analysis of nine patients and development of an RT-PCR assay for GLB1 gene expression profiling.
17221873|a|The human GLB1 gene produces two alternatively spliced transcripts that encode the lysosomal enzyme beta-galactosidase (GLB1) and the elastin binding protein (EBP). Mutations at the GLB1 locus, which are responsible for the storage disorder GM1 gangliosidosis, may affect either both proteins or GLB1 only. The EBP, when affected, contributes to specific features of GM1 gangliosidosis patients, such as cardiomyopathy and connective-tissue abnormalities. Here we report the development of reliable and quantitative assays based on real-time PCR for assessing the levels of GLB1 and EBP transcripts in patients' samples. We also report the characterisation of GLB1 gene mutations in nine GM1 gangliosidosis patients in order to correlate the genetic lesions with mRNA levels and phenotypes. Mutation analysis identified four new (c.1835_1836delCC; p.Arg148Cys; c.1068+1G>T; and p.Pro549Leu), five known (p.Arg59His; p.Arg201His; p.Gly123Arg; c.245+1G>A; and c.75+2insT) mutations and one new polymorphism (c.1233+8T>C). Comparative analysis of the patients' phenotypes enabled a more thorough correlation between GLB1 mutations and specific clinical manifestations. GLB1 and EBP mRNA levels were both reduced in three patients carrying the splicing defects. The accurate and fast method for the detection of alternatively spliced transcripts of the GLB1 gene could be applied to other disease-causing lysosomal genes that encode multiple mRNAs.

18456723|t|Subepicardial phase 0 block and discontinuous transmural conduction underlie right precordial ST-segment elevation by a SCN5A loss-of-function mutation.
18456723|a|Two mechanisms are generally proposed to explain right precordial ST-segment elevation in Brugada syndrome: 1) right ventricular (RV) subepicardial action potential shortening and/or loss of dome causing transmural dispersion of repolarization; and 2) RV conduction delay. Here we report novel mechanistic insights into ST-segment elevation associated with a Na(+) current (I(Na)) loss-of-function mutation from studies in a Dutch kindred with the COOH-terminal SCN5A variant p.Phe2004Leu. The proband, a man, experienced syncope at age 22 yr and had coved-type ST-segment elevations in ECG leads V1 and V2 and negative T waves in V2. Peak and persistent mutant I(Na) were significantly decreased. I(Na) closed-state inactivation was increased, slow inactivation accelerated, and recovery from inactivation delayed. Computer-simulated I(Na)-dependent excitation was decremental from endo- to epicardium at cycle length 1,000 ms, not at cycle length 300 ms. Propagation was discontinuous across the midmyocardial to epicardial transition region, exhibiting a long local delay due to phase 0 block. Beyond this region, axial excitatory current was provided by phase 2 (dome) of the M-cell action potentials and depended on L-type Ca(2+) current ("phase 2 conduction"). These results explain right precordial ST-segment elevation on the basis of RV transmural gradients of membrane potentials during early repolarization caused by discontinuous conduction. The late slow-upstroke action potentials at the subepicardium produce T-wave inversion in the computed ECG waveform, in line with the clinical ECG.

12677556|t|Genetic interaction of BBS1 mutations with alleles at other BBS loci can result in non-Mendelian Bardet-Biedl syndrome.
12677556|a|Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disorder caused by mutations in at least seven loci (BBS1-7), five of which are cloned (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS6, and BBS7). Genetic and mutational analyses have indicated that, in some families, a combination of three mutant alleles at two loci (triallelic inheritance) is necessary for pathogenesis. To date, four of the five known BBS loci have been implicated in this mode of oligogenic disease transmission. We present a comprehensive analysis of the spectrum, distribution, and involvement in non-Mendelian trait transmission of mutant alleles in BBS1, the most common BBS locus. Analyses of 259 independent families segregating a BBS phenotype indicate that BBS1 participates in complex inheritance and that, in different families, mutations in BBS1 can interact genetically with mutations at each of the other known BBS genes, as well as at unknown loci, to cause the phenotype. Consistent with this model, we identified homozygous M390R alleles, the most frequent BBS1 mutation, in asymptomatic individuals in two families. Moreover, our statistical analyses indicate that the prevalence of the M390R allele in the general population is consistent with an oligogenic rather than a recessive model of disease transmission. The distribution of BBS oligogenic alleles also indicates that all BBS loci might interact genetically with each other, but some genes, especially BBS2 and BBS6, are more likely to participate in triallelic inheritance, suggesting a variable ability of the BBS proteins to interact genetically with each other.

30630878|t|Association between the estrogen receptor α gene polymorphisms rs2234693 and rs9340799 and severe and mild pre-eclampsia: a meta-analysis.
30630878|a|This meta-analysis was performed in order to determine the associations between the estrogen receptor α (ESR1) gene PvuII site (-397T/C, rs2234693) and XbaI site (-351A/G, rs9340799) polymorphisms with severe and mild pre-eclampsia. Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed, Medline, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and WanFang databases until May 2018. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to calculate the associations. Six articles (consisting of seven studies; one article was considered as two separate studies with two different subpopulations) investigated the ESR1 gene PvuII -397T/C and XbaI -351A/G polymorphisms in severe and mild pre-eclampsia patients and included controls. The pooled results indicated an increased risk of severe pre-eclampsia for the XbaI -351A/G polymorphism (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.10-2.25, 

23148524|t|A homozygous mutation of voltage-gated sodium channel β(I)  gene SCN1B in a patient with Dravet syndrome.
23148524|a|Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy characterized by early onset epileptic seizures followed by ataxia and cognitive decline. Approximately 80% of patients with Dravet syndrome have been associated with heterozygous mutations in SCN1A gene encoding voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) α(I)  subunit, whereas a homozygous mutation (p.Arg125Cys) of SCN1B gene encoding VGSC β(I)  subunit was recently described in a patient with Dravet syndrome. To further examine the involvement of homozygous SCN1B mutations in the etiology of Dravet syndrome, we performed mutational analyses on SCN1B in 286 patients with epileptic disorders, including 67 patients with Dravet syndrome who have been negative for SCN1A and SCN2A mutations. In the cohort, we found one additional homozygous mutation (p.Ile106Phe) in a patient with Dravet syndrome. The identified homozygous SCN1B mutations indicate that SCN1B is an etiologic candidate underlying Dravet syndrome.

23056546|t|Association between CYP1A1 Ile462Val variation and acute leukemia risk: meta-analyses including 2164 cases and 4160 controls.
23056546|a|Previously, CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism has been indicated to be a risk factor for several malignancies. Increasing reports have focused on the association of CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphisms with susceptibility to acute leukemia and have generated controversial results. The goal of the present study was to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship.Relevant literature has been rigorously searched and screened. Eligible studies were identified for the period up to Apr 2012. Meta-analyses evaluating the association of CYP1A1 Ile462Val variation with acute leukemia were carried out. Subgroup analyses on ethnicity, clinical types and source of controls were further performed.A total of thirteen publications including fourteen case-control studies with 2164 cases and 4160 controls were selected for analysis. The overall data indicated a significant association of CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism with acute leukemia risk (Val/Val vs Ile/Ile OR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.11-1.98; dominant model: OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.05-1.51; recessive model: OR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.04-1.83). In subgroup analysis on ethnicity, increased risk was shown among mixed ethnicities (Val/Val vs Ile/Ile: OR = 2.36; 95% CI = 1.46-3.82; dominant model: OR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.01-1.86; recessive model: OR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.37-3.53) but not Asians or Caucasians. In subgroup analysis on clinical types, increased risk was observed in the acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) subgroup (Val/Val vs Ile/Ile: OR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.42-3.01; recessive model: OR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.32-2.76) but not in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subgroup.The results of the present study suggest that CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism might be a low-penetrant risk factor for acute leukemia. Subgroup analyses suggest that homozygous Val/Val alleles might modify the susceptibility to ALL.

30038396|t|Gene discovery and polygenic prediction from a genome-wide association study of educational attainment in 1.1 million individuals.
30038396|a|Here we conducted a large-scale genetic association analysis of educational attainment in a sample of approximately 1.1 million individuals and identify 1,271 independent genome-wide-significant SNPs. For the SNPs taken together, we found evidence of heterogeneous effects across environments. The SNPs implicate genes involved in brain-development processes and neuron-to-neuron communication. In a separate analysis of the X chromosome, we identify 10 independent genome-wide-significant SNPs and estimate a SNP heritability of around 0.3% in both men and women, consistent with partial dosage compensation. A joint (multi-phenotype) analysis of educational attainment and three related cognitive phenotypes generates polygenic scores that explain 11-13% of the variance in educational attainment and 7-10% of the variance in cognitive performance. This prediction accuracy substantially increases the utility of polygenic scores as tools in research.

21156761|t|A genome-wide association study suggests contrasting associations in ACPA-positive versus ACPA-negative rheumatoid arthritis.
21156761|a|Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be divided into two major subsets based on the presence or absence of antibodies to citrullinated peptide antigens (ACPA). Until now, data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have only been published from ACPA-positive subsets of RA or from studies that have not separated the two subsets. The aim of the current study is to provide and compare GWAS data for both subsets.GWAS using the Illumina 300K chip was performed for 774 ACPA-negative patients with RA, 1147 ACPA-positive patients with RA and 1079 controls from the Swedish population-based case-control study EIRA. Imputation was performed which allowed comparisons using 1,723,056 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). No SNP achieved genome-wide significance (2.9 × 10⁻⁸) in the comparison between ACPA-negative RA and controls. A case-case association study was then performed between ACPA-negative and ACPA-positive RA groups. The major difference in this analysis was in the HLA region where 768 HLA SNPs passed the threshold for genome-wide significance whereas additional contrasting SNPs did not reach genome-wide significance. However, one SNP close to the RPS12P4 locus in chromosome 2 reached a p value of 2 × 10⁶ and this locus can thus be considered as a tentative candidate locus for ACPA-negative RA.ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative RA display significant risk allele frequency differences which are mainly confined to the HLA region. The data provide further support for distinct genetic aetiologies of RA subsets and emphasise the need to consider them separately in genetic as well as functional studies of this disease.

8244332|t|Molecular genetics of GM2-gangliosidosis AB variant: a novel mutation and expression in BHK cells.
8244332|a|The GM2 activator is a hexosaminidase A-specific glycolipid-binding protein required for the lysosomal degradation of ganglioside GM2. Genetic deficiency of GM2 activator leads to a neurological disorder, an atypical form of Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis variant AB). Here, we describe a G506 to C transversion (Arg169 to Pro) in the mRNA of an infantile patient suffering from GM2-gangliosidosis variant AB. Using the polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct-sequencing technique, we found the patient to be homozygous for the mutation, whereas the parents were, as expected, heterozygous. BHK cells transfected with a construct of mutant cDNA gave no GM2 activator protein detectable by the Western blotting technique, whereas those transfected by a wild-type cDNA construct showed a significant level of human GM2 activator protein. The substitution of proline for the normal Arg169 therefore appears to result in premature degradation of the mutant GM2 activator, either during the post-translational processing steps or after reaching the lysosome. The basis for the phenotype of GM2 gangliosidosis variant AB may therefore be either inactivation of the physiological activator function by the point mutation or instability of the mutant protein.

10200054|t|Missense mutation in exon 11 (Codon 378) of the presenilin-1 gene in a French family with early-onset Alzheimer's disease and transmission study by mismatch enhanced allele specific amplification. Mutations in brief no. 141. Online. besancon@rockefeller1.univ.lyon1.fr.
10200054|a|Mutations in the presenilin-1 (PS1) gene account for the majority of familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) cases. We screened the coding part of the PS1 gene for the present of mutations in a French family with EOAD, using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Patients in the pedigree showed a missense mutation in exon 11 of the PS1 gene involving a transition of G to A, altering glycine to glutamate at codon 378. The cosegregation of the mutation with EOAD in the family was studied by allele specific amplification, enhanced by the introduction of a mismatch at the penultimate position near the 3' primer end. The mutation has not been described before and is located within the third large cytoplasmic loop and may lead to the appearance of a short additional a-helix.

21241800|t|Biophysical properties of mutant KCNQ1 S277L channels linked to hereditary long QT syndrome with phenotypic variability.
21241800|a|Hereditary long QT syndrome (LQTS) is associated with ventricular torsade de pointes tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Mutations in a cardiac voltage-gated potassium channel, KCNQ1, induce the most frequent variant of LQTS. We identified a KCNQ1 missense mutation, KCNQ1 S277L, in a patient presenting with recurrent syncope triggered by emotional stress (QTc=528ms). This mutation is located in the conserved S5 transmembrane region of the KCNQ1 channel. Using in vitro electrophysiological testing in the Xenopus oocyte expression system, the S277L mutation was found to be non-functional and to suppress wild type currents in dominant-negative fashion in the presence and in the absence of the regulatory ß-subunit, KCNE1. In addition, expression of S277L and wild type KCNQ1 with KCNE1 resulted in a shift of the voltage-dependence of activation by -8.7mV compared to wild type I(Ks), indicating co-assembly of mutant and wild type subunits. The electrophysiological phenotype corresponds well with the severe clinical phenotype of the index patient. However, investigation of family members revealed three patients that exhibit asymptomatic QT interval prolongation (QTc=493-518ms). In conclusion, this study emphasizes the value of biophysical testing to provide mechanistic evidence for pathogenicity of ion channel mutations identified in LQTS patients. The inconsistent association of the KCNQ1 S277L mutation with the clinical presentation suggests that additional genetic, epigenetic, or environmental factors play a role in defining the individual clinical LQTS phenotype.

25611685|t|Results of clinical genetic testing of 2,912 probands with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: expanded panels offer limited additional sensitivity.
25611685|a|Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused primarily by pathogenic variants in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. We report genetic testing results for HCM in 2,912 unrelated individuals with nonsyndromic presentations from a broad referral population over 10 years.Genetic testing was performed by Sanger sequencing for 10 genes from 2004 to 2007, by HCM CardioChip for 11 genes from 2007 to 2011 and by next-generation sequencing for 18, 46, or 51 genes from 2011 onward.The detection rate is ~32% among unselected probands, with inconclusive results in an additional 15%. Detection rates were not significantly different between adult and pediatric probands but were higher in females compared with males. An expanded gene panel encompassing more than 50 genes identified only a very small number of additional pathogenic variants beyond those identifiable in our original panels, which examined 11 genes. Familial genetic testing in at-risk family members eliminated the need for longitudinal cardiac evaluations in 691 individuals. Based on the projected costs derived from Medicare fee schedules for the recommended clinical evaluations of HCM family members by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association, our data indicate that genetic testing resulted in a minimum cost savings of about $0.7 million.Clinical HCM genetic testing provides a definitive molecular diagnosis for many patients and provides cost savings to families. Expanded gene panels have not substantively increased the clinical sensitivity of HCM testing, suggesting major additional causes of HCM still remain to be identified.

30863424|t|Association of Candidate Gene Polymorphisms With Chronic Kidney Disease: Results of a Case-Control Analysis in the Nefrona Cohort.
30863424|a|Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major risk factor for end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease and premature death. Despite classical clinical risk factors for CKD and some genetic risk factors have been identified, the residual risk observed in prediction models is still high. Therefore, new risk factors need to be identified in order to better predict the risk of CKD in the population. Here, we analyzed the genetic association of 79 SNPs of proteins associated with mineral metabolism disturbances with CKD in a cohort that includes 2,445 CKD cases and 559 controls. Genotyping was performed with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. We used logistic regression models considering different genetic inheritance models to assess the association of the SNPs with the prevalence of CKD, adjusting for known risk factors. Eight SNPs (rs1126616, rs35068180, rs2238135, rs1800247, rs385564, rs4236, rs2248359, and rs1564858) were associated with CKD even after adjusting by sex, age and race. A model containing five of these SNPs (rs1126616, rs35068180, rs1800247, rs4236, and rs2248359), diabetes and hypertension showed better performance than models considering only clinical risk factors, significantly increasing the area under the curve of the model without polymorphisms. Furthermore, one of the SNPs (the rs2248359) showed an interaction with hypertension, being the risk genotype affecting only hypertensive patients. We conclude that 5 SNPs related to proteins implicated in mineral metabolism disturbances (Osteopontin, osteocalcin, matrix gla protein, matrix metalloprotease 3 and 24 hydroxylase) are associated to an increased risk of suffering CKD.

28991256|t|Genome-wide association analysis identifies 30 new susceptibility loci for schizophrenia.
28991256|a|We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with replication in 36,180 Chinese individuals and performed further transancestry meta-analyses with data from the Psychiatry Genomics Consortium (PGC2). Approximately 95% of the genome-wide significant (GWS) index alleles (or their proxies) from the PGC2 study were overrepresented in Chinese schizophrenia cases, including ∼50% that achieved nominal significance and ∼75% that continued to be GWS in the transancestry analysis. The Chinese-only analysis identified seven GWS loci; three of these also were GWS in the transancestry analyses, which identified 109 GWS loci, thus yielding a total of 113 GWS loci (30 novel) in at least one of these analyses. We observed improvements in the fine-mapping resolution at many susceptibility loci. Our results provide several lines of evidence supporting candidate genes at many loci and highlight some pathways for further research. Together, our findings provide novel insight into the genetic architecture and biological etiology of schizophrenia.

21960694|t|Common polymorphisms in the adiponectin and its receptor genes, adiponectin levels and the risk of prostate cancer.
21960694|a|Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is inversely associated with adiposity and prostate cancer risk and progression. However, the role of genetic variation in the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and receptor genes (ADIPOR1/R2) in prostate cancer is largely unknown.In a nested case-control study of 1,286 cases and 1,267 controls within the Physicians' Health Study, we evaluated 29 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in ADIPOQ (n = 13), ADIPOR1 (n = 5), and ADIPOR2 (n = 11) in relation to the risk of prostate cancer. In subgroups, we also evaluated the association of genotype and circulating adiponectin levels (n = 951) and prostate tumor expression of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-IR) receptor (n = 181).Among the 12 tagging polymorphisms in ADIPOQ, four (rs266729, rs182052, rs822391, and rs2082940) were significantly associated (P < 0.05) with overall prostate cancer risk, with no significant difference by tumor grade or clinical stage. Two of the risk SNPs (rs266729 and rs182052) plus four other SNPs (rs16861209, rs17366568, rs3774261, and rs7639352) were also associated with plasma adiponectin levels, and three of these (rs1686109, rs17366568, and rs3774261) were also significantly associated with IR expression in prostate tumor tissue. One additional SNP was associated with IGFI-R tumor tissue expression (rs16861205). None of the 16 variants in ADIPOR1/R2 were related to cancer risk or circulating adiponectin levels.Common variants in the adiponectin gene were associated with prostate cancer risk, plasma adiponectin levels, and IR or IGF-IR expression in the prostate tumor.These genotype-phenotype associations support the biological relevance of adiponectin for prostate carcinogenesis, particularly in earlier stages of development.

31231134|t|Sex specific associations in genome wide association analysis of renal cell carcinoma.

We conducted the first sex-specific genome-wide association analysis of RCC for men (3227 cases, 4916 controls) and women (1992 cases, 3095 controls) of European ancestry from two RCC genome-wide scans and replicated the top findings using an additional series of men (2261 cases, 5852 controls) and women (1399 cases, 1575 controls) from two independent cohorts of European origin. Our study confirmed sex-specific associations for two known RCC risk loci at 14q24.2 (DPF3) and 2p21(EPAS1). We also identified two additional suggestive male-specific loci at 6q24.3 (SAMD5, male odds ratio (OR

22519808|t|Long QT syndrome and dilated cardiomyopathy with SCN5A p.R1193Q polymorphism: cardioverter-defibrillator implantation at 27 months.
22519808|a|Cardiac sodium channel dysfunction associated with the SCN5A gene presents with mixed phenotypes, including long QT syndrome type 3, sinus node dysfunction, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We report a Korean case of an overlap syndrome of cardiac sodium channelopathy with SCN5A p.R1193Q polymorphism, treated by the placement of an intrapericardial implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) at the age of 27 months. Although the patient received two appropriate life-saving shocks for ventricular fibrillations, he eventually died of DCM progression. However, this case shows that intrapericardial ICD implantation is feasible in young children with a high risk for sudden cardiac death.

2106480|t|Use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to detect point mutations in the factor VIII gene.
2106480|a|Point mutations in the factor VIII gene are responsible for the majority of cases of hemophilia A, and only a small fraction of these mutations can be recognized by restriction endonuclease analysis. We have now used polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to characterize single nucleotide substitutions in the factor VIII gene. Five regions of the gene were studied: exon 8, the 3' end of exon 14, exon 17, exon 18, and exon 24. A GC clamp was attached to the 5' PCR primer to allow detection of the majority of single base changes in DNA fragments ranging from 249 to 356 bp. Ten of eleven known point mutations were definitively separated. Fifty-two patients with unknown mutations were then studied by these methods, and the disease-producing mutation was found in three. First, we identified a new missense mutation in exon 14 which is the likely cause of hemophilia A in one patient (tyrosine changed to cysteine at amino acid residue 1709). Second, we found a new missense mutation in exon 18 in one patient (asparagine to aspartic acid at amino acid residue 1922). Third, a previously described mutation in exon 24 was detected (arginine changed to glutamine at amino acid residue 2209). In addition, a new polymorphic nucleotide substitution was found in intron 7. Moreover, these mutations can be detected when the GC-clamped PCR products from all five regions are run in the same denaturing gel. Our results indicate that denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis can be successfully applied to the analysis of point mutations in large genes whose transcripts are not readily available.

1985460|t|A 3-bp deletion in the rhodopsin gene in a family with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.
1985460|a|Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) has recently been linked to locus D3S47 (probe C17), with no recombination, in a single large Irish family. Other ADRP pedigrees have shown linkage at zero recombination, linkage with recombination, and no linkage, demonstrating genetic heterogeneity. The gene encoding rhodopsin, the rod photoreceptor pigment, is closely linked to locus D3S47 on chromosome 3q. A point mutation changing a conserved proline to histidine in the 23d codon of the gene has been demonstrated in affected members of one ADRP family and in 17 of 148 unrelated ADRP patients. We have sequenced the rhodopsin gene in a C17-linked ADRP family and have identified in the 4th exon and in-frame 3-bp deletion which deletes one of the two isoleucine monomers at codons 255 and 256. This mutation was not found in 30 other unrelated ADRP families. The deletion has arisen in the sequence TCATCATCAT, deleting one of a run of three x 3-bp repeats. The mechanism by which this occurred may be similar to that which creates length variation in so-called mini- and microsatellites. Thus ADRP is an extremely heterogeneous disorder which can result from a range of defects in rhodopsin and which can have a locus or loci elsewhere in the genome.

1642278|t|Tyrosinase gene mutations in type I (tyrosinase-deficient) oculocutaneous albinism define two clusters of missense substitutions.
1642278|a|Type I (tyrosinase-deficient) oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) results from mutations of the gene encoding tyrosinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first 2 steps of melanin pigment biosynthesis. In type IA (tyrosinase-negative) OCA tyrosinase enzymatic activity is completely absent, and in type IB ("yellow") OCA tyrosinase activity is greatly reduced. Here, we describe 11 novel mutations of the tyrosinase gene in Caucasian patients with these 2 forms of type I OCA. Type I OCA in Caucasians appears to result from a great variety of different uncommon alleles. More than 80% of the known missense substitutions associated with type I OCA cluster within 2 relatively small regions of the tyrosinase polypeptide, suggesting that these may correspond to functionally important sites within the enzyme.

20976770|t|Early onset collagen VI myopathies: Genetic and clinical correlations.
20976770|a|Mutations in the genes encoding the extracellular matrix protein collagen VI (ColVI) cause a spectrum of disorders with variable inheritance including Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, Bethlem myopathy, and intermediate phenotypes. We extensively characterized, at the clinical, cellular, and molecular levels, 49 patients with onset in the first 2 years of life to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations.Patients were classified into 3 groups: early-severe (18%), moderate-progressive (53%), and mild (29%). ColVI secretion was analyzed in patient-derived skin fibroblasts. Chain-specific transcript levels were quantified by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and mutation identification was performed by sequencing of complementary DNA.ColVI secretion was altered in all fibroblast cultures studied. We identified 56 mutations, mostly novel and private. Dominant de novo mutations were detected in 61% of the cases. Importantly, mutations causing premature termination codons (PTCs) or in-frame insertions strikingly destabilized the corresponding transcripts. Homozygous PTC-causing mutations in the triple helix domains led to the most severe phenotypes (ambulation never achieved), whereas dominant de novo in-frame exon skipping and glycine missense mutations were identified in patients of the moderate-progressive group (loss of ambulation).This work emphasizes that the diagnosis of early onset ColVI myopathies is arduous and time-consuming, and demonstrates that quantitative RT-PCR is a helpful tool for the identification of some mutation-bearing genes. Moreover, the clinical classification proposed allowed genotype-phenotype relationships to be explored, and may be useful in the design of future clinical trials.

11420676|t|Characterization of germline TP53 splicing mutations and their genetic and functional analysis.
11420676|a|Germline TP53 splicing mutations have been described infrequently (>2%) in the literature, however in a series of 40 patients and families identified by our group in which there are germline TP53 mutations, seven affect splicing (18%). The low figure reported in the literature might reflect the method of mutation detection, which in many studies does not include all splice junctions. These data indicate that a significant proportion of TP53 germline mutations are currently unrecognized. We have carried out detailed studies of the effects of the different mutations on splicing, and see distinct variations in the effects of the same mutation in different patients. Furthermore we have identified the usage of a non-consensus splice donor site in four families with an intron 4 splice donor mutation.

15266303|t|Complete genomic structure of the human nebulin gene and identification of alternatively spliced transcripts.
15266303|a|The giant nebulin protein is a fundamental structural component of the thin filaments of the striated muscle sarcomere. Nebulin binds to actin and the size of nebulin correlates with actin filament length, suggesting that nebulin may determine the length of the thin filaments during myofibrillogenesis. We have previously described the genomic organization of the 3' end of the nebulin gene (NEB), and identified 18 different NEB mutations in patients with autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy. Here we present the genomic organization of the entire nebulin gene, and the identification of numerous alternatively spliced mRNAs. The gene comprises 183 exons spanning 249 kb of the genomic sequence. The translation initiation codon is in exon 3, and the stop codon and the 3' UTR are in exon 183. There are four regions with alternatively spliced exons, that is, exons 63-66, 82-105, 143-144 and 166-177, giving rise to a number of different transcripts. The alternatively spliced exons 143-144 give rise to two different transcripts varying between muscle types and between muscles of different developmental stages. The alternatively spliced exons 166-177 express at least 20 different transcripts in adult human tibialis anterior muscle alone. Preliminary results show several transcripts in both of the two remaining alternatively spliced regions. Extensive alternative splicing of NEB may explain why nemaline myopathy patients with homozygous truncating mutations show expression of the carboxy-terminus of the nebulin protein contrary to expectations. The use of alternative transcripts might also explain why severe phenotypes are rare among patients with two truncating mutations.

12442275|t|BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation analysis of early-onset and familial breast cancer cases in Mexico.
12442275|a|The entire coding regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were screened for mutations by heteroduplex analysis in 51 Mexican breast cancer patients. One BRCA1 and one BRCA2 truncating mutation each was identified in the group of 32 (6%) early-onset breast cancer patients (< or =35 years). Besides these two likely deleterious mutations, eight rare variants of unknown significance, mostly in the BRCA2 gene, were detected in six of 32 (19%) early-onset breast cancer cases and in three of 17 (18%) site-specific breast cancer families, one containing a male breast cancer case. No mutations or rare sequence variants have been identified in two additional families including each an early-onset breast cancer case and an ovarian cancer patient. The two truncating mutations (BRCA1 3857delT; BRCA2 2663-2664insA) and six of the rare variants have never been reported before and may be of country-specific origin. The majority of the alterations appeared to be distinct, with only one of them being observed in more than one family.

19343596|t|The R620W polymorphism of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 22 gene in autoimmune thyroid diseases and rheumatoid arthritis in the Tunisian population.
19343596|a|Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22) is involved in the negative regulation of T-cell responsiveness. The association of a coding variant of the PTPN22 gene (R620W) with a number of autoimmune diseases has been described.The present study investigated whether PTPN22 gene polymorphism was also involved in the genetic predisposition to autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a Tunisian case control study.DNA samples from 150 patients affected with RA, 204 patients affected with AITDs and 236 healthy controls were genotyped for PTPN22 R620W polymorphism (1858C/T). Genotyping was performed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.No significant differences in T allele frequency (2.3% in RA patients and 1% in AITDs patients vs 2.6% in controls; p=0.85 and p=0.08, respectively) and in genotype frequencies were detected between RA patients and controls (p=0.15) and between AITDs patients (p=0.11). Stratifying patients affected with AITDs according to their phenotype (Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and RA patients according to the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides (ACPA) did not show any significant association with PTPN22 R620W allele (p>0.05).Our data suggest that the PTPN22 C1858T single nucleotide polymorphism has no or minor effect on RA and AITDs susceptibility in the Tunisian population.

16969279|t|No association of the C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism with schizophrenia.
16969279|a|Some serological and genetic studies have suggested that alterations in folate metabolism are associated with increased vulnerability to schizophrenia. In particular, these findings are most striking for the role of a putatively functional variant (C677T) in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. To test the hypothesis that the T allele and the TT genotype are risk factors for psychosis, we genotyped the C677T polymorphism in 206 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 359 participants from a population control sample. Neither the T allele nor the TT genotype was associated with increased risk for schizophrenia. These results do not support a role for the C677T MTHFR variant in schizophrenia.

26619011|t|Identifying recurrent mutations in cancer reveals widespread lineage diversity and mutational specificity.
26619011|a|Mutational hotspots indicate selective pressure across a population of tumor samples, but their prevalence within and across cancer types is incompletely characterized. An approach to detect significantly mutated residues, rather than methods that identify recurrently mutated genes, may uncover new biologically and therapeutically relevant driver mutations. Here, we developed a statistical algorithm to identify recurrently mutated residues in tumor samples. We applied the algorithm to 11,119 human tumors, spanning 41 cancer types, and identified 470 somatic substitution hotspots in 275 genes. We find that half of all human tumors possess one or more mutational hotspots with widespread lineage-, position- and mutant allele-specific differences, many of which are likely functional. In total, 243 hotspots were novel and appeared to affect a broad spectrum of molecular function, including hotspots at paralogous residues of Ras-related small GTPases RAC1 and RRAS2. Redefining hotspots at mutant amino acid resolution will help elucidate the allele-specific differences in their function and could have important therapeutic implications. 

27460420|t|An innovative strategy for the molecular diagnosis of Usher syndrome identifies causal biallelic mutations in 93% of European patients.
27460420|a|Usher syndrome (USH), the most prevalent cause of hereditary deafness-blindness, is an autosomal recessive and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Three clinical subtypes (USH1-3) are distinguishable based on the severity of the sensorineural hearing impairment, the presence or absence of vestibular dysfunction, and the age of onset of the retinitis pigmentosa. A total of 10 causal genes, 6 for USH1, 3 for USH2, and 1 for USH3, and an USH2 modifier gene, have been identified. A robust molecular diagnosis is required not only to improve genetic counseling, but also to advance gene therapy in USH patients. Here, we present an improved diagnostic strategy that is both cost- and time-effective. It relies on the sequential use of three different techniques to analyze selected genomic regions: targeted exome sequencing, comparative genome hybridization, and quantitative exon amplification. We screened a large cohort of 427 patients (139 USH1, 282 USH2, and six of undefined clinical subtype) from various European medical centers for mutations in all USH genes and the modifier gene. We identified a total of 421 different sequence variants predicted to be pathogenic, about half of which had not been previously reported. Remarkably, we detected large genomic rearrangements, most of which were novel and unique, in 9% of the patients. Thus, our strategy led to the identification of biallelic and monoallelic mutations in 92.7% and 5.8% of the USH patients, respectively. With an overall 98.5% mutation characterization rate, the diagnosis efficiency was substantially improved compared with previously reported methods.

11013452|t|Identification and characterization of two novel mutations that produce acute intermittent porphyria: A 3-base deletion (841-843delGGA) and a missense mutation (T35M).
11013452|a|A partial deficiency of Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) is responsible for acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and the prevalence in the Argentinean population is about 1:125,000. Here, two new mutations and two previously reported were found in the PBGD gene in 22 Argentinean AIP patients corresponding to 8 different families. To screen for AIP mutations in symptomatic patients, genomic DNA isolated was amplified in 6 PCR reactions, then all coding exons and flanking intronic regions were sequenced. The novel mutations are 841-843delGGA in exon 14, which results in the loss of glycine-281 (G281del), and one 104C>T point mutation in the exon 4 (T35M). To further characterize both novel mutations, the pKK-PBGD construct for the mutant alleles were expressed in E. coli, the enzymatic activity of the recombinant proteins were 1% and 4% of the mean level expressed by the normal allele for 841-843delGGA and T35M, respectively.

21051598|t|The major genetic determinants of HIV-1 control affect HLA class I peptide presentation.
21051598|a|Infectious and inflammatory diseases have repeatedly shown strong genetic associations within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC); however, the basis for these associations remains elusive. To define host genetic effects on the outcome of a chronic viral infection, we performed genome-wide association analysis in a multiethnic cohort of HIV-1 controllers and progressors, and we analyzed the effects of individual amino acids within the classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins. We identified >300 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the MHC and none elsewhere. Specific amino acids in the HLA-B peptide binding groove, as well as an independent HLA-C effect, explain the SNP associations and reconcile both protective and risk HLA alleles. These results implicate the nature of the HLA-viral peptide interaction as the major factor modulating durable control of HIV infection.

30595370|t|Leveraging Polygenic Functional Enrichment to Improve GWAS Power.
30595370|a|Functional genomics data has the potential to increase GWAS power by identifying SNPs that have a higher prior probability of association. Here, we introduce a method that leverages polygenic functional enrichment to incorporate coding, conserved, regulatory, and LD-related genomic annotations into association analyses. We show via simulations with real genotypes that the method, functionally informed novel discovery of risk loci (FINDOR), correctly controls the false-positive rate at null loci and attains a 9%-38% increase in the number of independent associations detected at causal loci, depending on trait polygenicity and sample size. We applied FINDOR to 27 independent complex traits and diseases from the interim UK Biobank release (average N = 130K). Averaged across traits, we attained a 13% increase in genome-wide significant loci detected (including a 20% increase for disease traits) compared to unweighted raw p values that do not use functional data. We replicated the additional loci in independent UK Biobank and non-UK Biobank data, yielding a highly statistically significant replication slope (0.66-0.69) in each case. Finally, we applied FINDOR to the full UK Biobank release (average N = 416K), attaining smaller relative improvements (consistent with simulations) but larger absolute improvements, detecting an additional 583 GWAS loci. In conclusion, leveraging functional enrichment using our method robustly increases GWAS power.

16981056|t|Dilated cardiomyopathy caused by LMNA mutations. Clinical and morphological studies.
16981056|a|Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is familial in about 20-35% of patients. The most frequently encountered mutations associated with DCM are found in LMNA.To define the frequency of LMNA mutations in a series of consecutive DCM patients and to evaluate the phenotype of mutation carriers.We screened the 12 exons of LMNA in a series of 61 Polish patients with DCM diagnosed angiographically, as well as in two DCM families.Two mutations were detected in 5 mutation carriers (D192G in one proband and Y481Stop in one proband and 3 of his offspring), which represents 3.3% (2/61) of the DCM patients. These mutations were absent from 100 controls. The D192G mutation was found in a 26-year-old patient with mild DCM and heart failure leading to death within two years after onset of symptoms. Mild conduction disease was also present. Ultrastructural analysis of the endomyocardial biopsy showed a striking alteration of nuclear morphology. This finding can explain nuclear fragility and is in agreement with the pathophysiological mechanical hypothesis of LMNA mutations. All four Y481Stop mutation-carriers were affected. Three phenotypes were found: in the proband, cardiac dysrhythmia and pacemaker requirement preceded DCM leading to heart transplantation; the proband's 13-year old daughter had conduction disease (2nd degree A-V block) with subtle skeletal muscle involvement documented by immunofluorescence study; ventricular arrhythmia was detected in the proband's son at the age of 11 and in the proband's daughter at the age of 18. Serum creatine kinase was normal in all mutation carriers.

20020534|t|AlphaIIbbeta3 integrin: new allelic variants in Glanzmann thrombasthenia, effects on ITGA2B and ITGB3 mRNA splicing, expression, and structure-function.
20020534|a|Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is an autosomal recessive inherited bleeding disorder characterized by an impaired platelet aggregation due to defects in integrin alphaIIbbeta3 (ITGA2B, ITGB3), a fibrinogen receptor. Mutations from 24 GT patients and two carriers of various origins, Caucasian, North-African and Asian were characterized. Promoter and exon sequences of alphaIIb and beta3 genes were amplified and directly sequenced. Among 29 identified mutations, 17 new allelic variants resulting from nonsense, missense and deletion/insertion mutations were described. RNA alterations were evaluated by using Web servers. The alphaIIb p.S926L, p.V903F, and beta3 p.C38Y, p.M118R, p.G221D substitutions prevented complex expression at the surface of COS-7 cells by altering the alphaIIb or the beta3 subunit structure. As shown by free energy analyses applied on the resolved structure of alphaIIbbeta3 and structural modeling of the mutant, the p.K253M substitution of beta3 helped to define a key role of the K253 in the interaction of the alphaIIb beta-propeller and the beta3 beta-I domains. finally, the alphaIIb p.Q595H substitution allowed cell surface expression of the complex but its corresponding c.2800G>T mutation is predicted to alter normal RNA splicing. In conclusion, our study yielded the discovery of 17 new GT allelic variants, revealed the key role of K253 of alphaIIb for the alphaIIbbeta3 complex formation and provides an additional example of an apparently missense mutation causing a splicing defect.

7540133|t|A change in gating mode leading to increased intrinsic Cl- channel activity compensates for defective processing in a cystic fibrosis mutant corresponding to a mild form of the disease.
7540133|a|The effects of the mild cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation P574H were analysed and compared with those of three severe ones (delta I507, delta F508 and R560T). Immunochemical and functional analyses indicate that the rank order of CFTR expression at the cell surface is: wild type CFTR > P574H >> delta F508 >> R560T approximately 0. Patch-clamp analysis indicates that the open probability of P574H Cl- channels is almost twice as high as that of the wild type CFTR-Cl- channel. This increased intrinsic activity of individual P574H CFTR-Cl- channels compensates for the lower number of P574H CFTR-Cl- channels reaching the cell surface, and probably explains the milder form of CF associated with the P574H mutation. NS004, a recently described activator, restores near normal CFTR activity in cells expressing the P574H-CFTR channel. The P574H mutation modifies the gating mode of the channel with a large increase (approximately x 7) in the mean channel open time. Proline 574 might play an important role in the process connecting ATP hydrolysis at the nucleotide binding domain and opening and closing events of the CFTR-Cl- channel.

27915083|t|Pharmacodynamic and cytogenetic evaluation in CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 allelomorphism in South Indian population with clopidogrel therapy.
27915083|a|Genetic factors play a significant role in pathogenesis of most diseases of heart. The present study was undertaken to correlate coronary artery disease with demographical, biochemical alterations, SNPs, gene expression and chromosomal abnormalities and for further enlightening the investigation in this field.150 patients taking clopidogrel drug were selected and single nucleotide polymorphism was done by PCR-RFLP techniques. With the same patients cytogenetic analysis was carried out on leukocyte cultures by karyotyping. Gene expression studies for 20 CAD patients and normal controls were done by RT-PCR techniques.In this study of patients with coronary artery disease the frequencies of the Extreme Metabolizers, Intermediate Metabolizers in CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285) were present in 90% and 10% but no Poor Metabolizers were found in this allele. The frequencies of Extreme Metabolizer, Intermediate Metabolizer and Poor Metabolizer in CYP2C19*3 (rs4986893) were present in 41%, 50% and 9% respectively. Among 20 CAD samples, 13 of 20 (65%) showed CYP2C19 gene over expression in CAD patients and all controls showed normal expression. Among the 150 CAD patients, 145 had normal karyotype, only five patients showed change in normal karyogram carried out by leukocyte culture.Genetic testing of CYP2C19 may help in prescribing a dose according to genetic makeup and represent the initial steps towards the development of diagnostic tests and therapeutic strategies that will substantially improve human health. This study highlights the progress that has been made in using pharmacogenomic and gene expression analysis, cardiovascular genomic research and the potential for applying these findings in clinical medicine.

24837172|t|Genome-wide association scan in north Indians reveals three novel HLA-independent risk loci for ulcerative colitis.
24837172|a|Over 100 ulcerative colitis (UC) loci have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) primarily in Caucasians (CEUs). Many of them have weak effects on disease susceptibility, and the bulk of the heritability cannot be ascribed to these loci. Very little is known about the genetic background of UC in non-CEU groups. Here we report the first GWAS on UC in a genetically distinct north Indian (NI) population.A genome-wide scan was performed on 700 cases and 761 controls. 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (p<5×10(-5)) were genotyped in an independent cohort of 733 cases and 1148 controls. A linear mixed model was used for case-control association tests.Seven novel human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-independent SNPs from chromosome 6, located in 3.8-1, BAT2, MSH5, HSPA1L, SLC44A4, CFB and NOTCH4, exceeded p<5×10(-8) in the combined analysis. To assess the independent biological contribution of such genes from the extended HLA region, we determined the percentage alternative pathway activity of complement factor B (CFB), the top novel hit. The activity was significantly different (p=0.01) between the different genotypes at rs12614 in UC cases. Transethnic comparisons revealed a shared contribution of a fraction of UC risk genes between NI and CEU populations, in addition to genetic heterogeneity.This study shows varying contribution of the HLA region to UC in different populations. Different environmental exposures and the characteristic genetic structure of the HLA locus across ethnic groups collectively make it amenable to the discovery of causative alleles by transethnic resequencing. This may lead to an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying UC.

26497376|t|Impact of whole exome sequencing among Iranian patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.
26497376|a|Non-syndromic autosomal recessive Retinitis Pigmentosa (arRP) is a highly heterogeneous genetic visual disorder with a large number of causative genes. We aimed to determine the power of Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) in the identification of the genes responsible for non-syndromic arRP among Iranian patients.We used WES, followed by the Sanger sequencing to identify the underlying gene mutations causing non-syndromic arRP.Our study revealed disease-causing mutations in known arRP genes for 10 of the 13 families studied (76.9%). These mutations included two-frameshift insertion/deletion in CRB1 and ABCA4, one splicing mutation in PDE6B, four missense mutations in RP1, CRB1, PANK2 and IFT140, as well as three stop codon mutations in RDH12, PRCD, and C2orf71. Three remaining families harbored no mutation in previously known RP genes. Of the 10 diseases causing mutations identified among the investigated Iranian patients with non-syndromic arRP, eight variants had not been reported previously. We confirmed segregation of all 10 mutations with disease phenotypes in our studied population.This study supports the genetic heterogeneity of non-syndromic arRP in Iranian patients, and provides an opportunity to show the effectiveness of WES in the identification of pathogenic mutations among patients with non-syndromic arRP born to consanguineous parents.

10331951|t|Bestrophin gene mutations in patients with Best vitelliform macular dystrophy.
10331951|a|Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD2) is an autosomal dominant dystrophy with a juvenile age of onset. Mutations in the Bestrophin gene were shown in patients affected with VMD2. In a mutation study, we made three new and interesting observations. First, we identified possible mutation hotspots within the gene, suggesting that particular regions of the protein have greater functional significance than others. Second, we described a 2-bp deletion in a part of the gene where mutations have not previously been reported; this mutation causes a frameshift and subsequent premature termination of the protein. Finally, we have evidence that some mutations are associated with variable expression of the disease, suggesting the involvement of other factors or genes in the disease phenotype.

11686223|t|Mutation analysis of the HFE gene in German hemochromatosis patients and controls using automated SSCP-based capillary electrophoresis and a new PCR-ELISA technique.
11686223|a|The diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) before the onset of iron-overload has been difficult in the past. However, a convincing candidate gene for HH: HFE has been described recently. The aims of this study were: 1) To determine the prevalence of the hemochromatosis associated mutations C282Y and H63D of the HFE gene in patients from Southern Germany with hemochromatosis phenotype; and 2) to test two new, time- and cost-saving methods: automated SSCP-based capillary electrophoresis (SSCP-CE) and a PCR-ELISA technique for the analysis of HFE mutations.HFE genotype was studied in 36 unrelated HH patients and 126 controls from Southern Germany. In addition, family screening was performed in 76 relatives. The C282Y and H63D mutations were detected using SSCP-CE and restriction length polymorphism (RFLP). The C282Y mutation was additionally analysed by a PCR-ELISA.Twenty-six (72%) HH patients were homozygous for mutation C282Y, and three compound heterozygous for C282Y and H63D. One patient was homozygous for H63D. By performing family screening, six additional patients with the +/+ C282Y mutation were identified. The results of the SSCP-CE and the PCR-ELISA analysis agreed completely with data obtained by RFLP.SSCP-CE and PCR-ELISA analysis proved to be reliable methods for HFE genotyping and therefore represent cost- and time-effective alternative methods to the widely used restriction analysis allowing large populations to be screened for HH associated with HFE mutations. Surprisingly, only 72% of our HH patients had the C282Y +/+ genotype. This indicates that hemochromatosis in Southern Germany is genetically more heterogeneous than in other regions. A challenge for the future will be to define the genetic or environmental factors responsible for iron-overload in HH patients who do not show typical alterations of the HFE gene.

20884846|t|Multiple genetic loci influence serum urate levels and their relationship with gout and cardiovascular disease risk factors.
20884846|a|Elevated serum urate levels can lead to gout and are associated with cardiovascular risk factors. We performed a genome-wide association study to search for genetic susceptibility loci for serum urate and gout and investigated the causal nature of the associations of serum urate with gout and selected cardiovascular risk factors and coronary heart disease (CHD).Meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed in 5 population-based cohorts of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genome Epidemiology consortium for serum urate and gout in 28 283 white participants. The effect of the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphism at all genome-wide significant loci on serum urate was added to create a genetic urate score. Findings were replicated in the Women's Genome Health Study (n=22 054). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms at 8 genetic loci achieved genome-wide significance with serum urate levels (P=4×10(-8) to 2×10(-242) in SLC22A11, GCKR, R3HDM2-INHBC region, RREB1, PDZK1, SLC2A9, ABCG2, and SLC17A1). Only 2 loci (SLC2A9, ABCG2) showed genome-wide significant association with gout. The genetic urate score was strongly associated with serum urate and gout (odds ratio, 12.4 per 100 μmol/L; P=3×10(-39)) but not with blood pressure, glucose, estimated glomerular filtration rate, chronic kidney disease, or CHD. The lack of association between the genetic score and the latter phenotypes also was observed in the Women's Genome Health Study.The genetic urate score analysis suggested a causal relationship between serum urate and gout but did not provide evidence for one between serum urate and cardiovascular risk factors and CHD.

22411443|t|A novel synonymous SNP in PITX3 is associated with Parkinson's disease in Chinese population.
22411443|a|Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 3 (PITX3) is an important transcription factor for differentiation and survival of dopaminergic neurons. Recent reports have shown a strong association of polymorphisms in the PITX3 gene with Parkinson's disease (PD). Our study was designed to verify whether three previous PITX3 SNPs (rs2281983, rs4919621 and rs3758549) were associated with PD in the Chinese population. We also investigate the association of novel polymorphisms in PITX3 gene with PD.All the polymorphisms of PITX3 we found in this study were sequenced by PCR products from both directions with dye terminator methods using an ABI-3100 sequencer. We included 356 sporadic PD patients and 300 healthy elderly people as controls.We provide evidence for strong association of a novel polymorphism c.219G>A (p = 0.000307) with PD. Our data showed that the substitution of c.219G>A in PITX3 Exon 3 was significantly higher in PD compared with control. Previous finding suggesting three SNPs (rs2281983, rs4919621 and rs3758549) in the PITX3 gene to be associated with PD could not be replicated.Our findings indicate that a novel synonymous SNP in PITX3 gene may contribute to PD risk in the Chinese population.
