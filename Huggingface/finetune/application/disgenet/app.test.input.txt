1590804	Leukocyte adhesion deficiency: identification of novel mutations in two Japanese patients with a severe form. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is a disorder with mutations of the gene for the beta subunit, a component common to three adhesion molecules; LFA-1, Mac-1 and p150,95. The molecular basis of the disorder was studied in two patients with its severe form. In the first patient, the mutant gene expressed an aberrant mRNA, 1.2 kb longer than usual, resulting from a G to A substitution at the splice donor site of a 1.2 kb intron. Several aberrantly spliced messages, arising from splicing at cryptic donor sites, were also identified. The beta subunit proteins deduced from the mRNA sequences lacked half the carboxyl terminal portion. In the second patient, the mutation was a G to A transition at nucleotide 454, which resulted in an Asp128 to Asn substitution of the beta subunit. The 128th Asp residue is located in a region crucial for the association with alpha subunits and strictly conserved among the integrin beta subunits so far analyzed.

15879175	A mutation in the TRPC6 cation channel causes familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a kidney disorder of unknown etiology, and up to 20% of patients on dialysis have been diagnosed with it. Here we show that a large family with hereditary FSGS carries a missense mutation in the TRPC6 gene on chromosome 11q, encoding the ion-channel protein transient receptor potential cation channel 6 (TRPC6). The proline-to-glutamine substitution at position 112, which occurs in a highly conserved region of the protein, enhances TRPC6-mediated calcium signals in response to agonists such as angiotensin II and appears to alter the intracellular distribution of TRPC6 protein. Previous work has emphasized the importance of cytoskeletal and structural proteins in proteinuric kidney diseases. Our findings suggest an alternative mechanism for the pathogenesis of glomerular disease.

24483153	A novel point mutation of the human glucocorticoid receptor gene causes primary generalized glucocorticoid resistance through impaired interaction with the LXXLL motif of the p160 coactivators: dissociation of the transactivating and transreppressive activities. Primary generalized glucocorticoid resistance is a rare genetic disorder characterized by generalized, partial, target-tissue insensitivity to glucocorticoids. The molecular basis of the condition has been ascribed to inactivating mutations in the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) gene.The objective of the study was to present three new cases caused by a novel mutation in the hGR gene and to delineate the molecular mechanisms through which the mutant receptor impairs glucocorticoid signal transduction.The index case (father) and his two daughters presented with increased urinary free cortisol excretion and resistance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to dexamethasone suppression in the absence of clinical manifestations suggestive of Cushing syndrome. All subjects harbored a novel, heterozygous, point mutation (T→G) at nucleotide position 1724 of the hGR gene, which resulted in substitution of valine by glycine at amino acid 575 of the receptor. Compared with the wild-type receptor, the hGRαV575G demonstrated a significant (33%) reduction in its ability to transactivate the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in response to dexamethasone, a 50% decrease in its affinity for the ligand, and a 2.5-fold delay in nuclear translocation. Although it did not exert a dominant negative effect on the wild-type receptor and preserved its ability to bind to DNA, hGRαV575G displayed significantly enhanced (∼80%) ability to transrepress the nuclear factor-κΒ signaling pathway. Finally, the mutant receptor hGRαV575G demonstrated impaired interaction with the LXXLL motif of the glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 coactivator in vitro and in computer-based structural simulation via its defective activation function-2 (AF-2) domain.The natural mutant receptor hGRαV575G causes primary generalized glucocorticoid resistance by affecting multiple steps in the glucocorticoid signaling cascade, including the affinity for the ligand, the time required for nuclear translocation, and the interaction with the glucocorticoid-interacting protein-1 coactivator.

9580132	Identification of a novel nonsense mutation and a missense substitution in the vasopressin-neurophysin II gene in two Spanish kindreds with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by deficiency in the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) encoded by the AVP-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene on chromosome 20p13. In this study, we analyzed two families with FNDI using direct automated fluorescent, solid phase, single-stranded DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified AVP-NPII DNA. In one of the families, affected individuals presented a novel nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the gene, consisting in a G to T transition at nucleotide 2101, which produces a stop signal in codon 82 (Glu) of NPII. The premature termination eliminates part of the C-terminal domain of NPII, including a cysteine residue in position 85, which could be involved in the correct folding of the prohormone. In the second family, a G279A substitution at position -1 of the signal peptide was observed in all affected individuals. This missense mutation, which replaces Ala with Thr, is frequent among FNDI patients and is thought to reduce the efficiency of cleavage by signal peptidases.

26061994	An intron SNP rs807185 in ATG4A decreases the risk of lung cancer in a southwest Chinese population. Autophagy acts as a double-edged sword in cancer. Over the years, there has been growing evidence of the involvement of autophagy-related genes (ATGs) in the etiology and progression of cancer. Importantly, lung cancer is one of the most common cancers and represents the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in developing countries. The genomic variant has emerged as an important factor in the risk of lung cancer. Here, we hypothesize that the intron single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of rs807185 in ATG4A is associated with the risk of lung cancer. In this case-control study, we genotyped the SNP rs807185 with PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Our data suggest that the variant A allele frequency of rs807185 in controls is higher than that in cases (37.7 vs. 24.9%, P=0.006). The adjusted odds ratio is 1.989 (95% confidence interval 1.223-3.236). Compared with the wild T allele, the variant A allele of rs807185 in ATG4A is associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer (adjusted odds ratio=0.605, 95% confidence interval 0.456-0.803, P<0.001). Furthermore, stratified analysis in a recessive model suggests that the homozygous variant genotype (AA) of rs807185 could decrease the risk of lung cancer in smoking or nonsmoking groups. In conclusion, the variant of intron SNP rs807185 in ATG4A is associated significantly with a decreased risk of lung cancer in a southwest Chinese population. The results show that the variant rs807185 of ATG4A might be a protective factor for lung cancer.

10200054	Missense mutation in exon 11 (Codon 378) of the presenilin-1 gene in a French family with early-onset Alzheimer's disease and transmission study by mismatch enhanced allele specific amplification. Mutations in brief no. 141. Online. besancon@rockefeller1.univ.lyon1.fr. Mutations in the presenilin-1 (PS1) gene account for the majority of familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) cases. We screened the coding part of the PS1 gene for the present of mutations in a French family with EOAD, using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Patients in the pedigree showed a missense mutation in exon 11 of the PS1 gene involving a transition of G to A, altering glycine to glutamate at codon 378. The cosegregation of the mutation with EOAD in the family was studied by allele specific amplification, enhanced by the introduction of a mismatch at the penultimate position near the 3' primer end. The mutation has not been described before and is located within the third large cytoplasmic loop and may lead to the appearance of a short additional a-helix.

2106480	Use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to detect point mutations in the factor VIII gene. Point mutations in the factor VIII gene are responsible for the majority of cases of hemophilia A, and only a small fraction of these mutations can be recognized by restriction endonuclease analysis. We have now used polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to characterize single nucleotide substitutions in the factor VIII gene. Five regions of the gene were studied: exon 8, the 3' end of exon 14, exon 17, exon 18, and exon 24. A GC clamp was attached to the 5' PCR primer to allow detection of the majority of single base changes in DNA fragments ranging from 249 to 356 bp. Ten of eleven known point mutations were definitively separated. Fifty-two patients with unknown mutations were then studied by these methods, and the disease-producing mutation was found in three. First, we identified a new missense mutation in exon 14 which is the likely cause of hemophilia A in one patient (tyrosine changed to cysteine at amino acid residue 1709). Second, we found a new missense mutation in exon 18 in one patient (asparagine to aspartic acid at amino acid residue 1922). Third, a previously described mutation in exon 24 was detected (arginine changed to glutamine at amino acid residue 2209). In addition, a new polymorphic nucleotide substitution was found in intron 7. Moreover, these mutations can be detected when the GC-clamped PCR products from all five regions are run in the same denaturing gel. Our results indicate that denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis can be successfully applied to the analysis of point mutations in large genes whose transcripts are not readily available.
